Register as a community amateur sports club (CASC)
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>If your sports club is eligible, you can become a community amateur sports club (CASC). You’ll get:</p>
<li>tax relief on income, gains and profits from some activities</li>
<li>Gift Aid repayments on donations</li>
<li>business rates relief</li>
<p>To benefit you must register with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
<p>You can claim relief on money you use to promote and provide facilities for eligible sports. These are known as ‘qualifying purposes’.</p>
<p>You can’t remove a CASC from the register (‘deregistration’) though you can close it if the club’s members vote and agree.</p>
<h2>CASCs and charities</h2>
<p>You must choose whether to register as a CASC or a charity. A registered CASC can’t be recognised as a charity for tax purposes.</p>
<p>CASCs aren’t regulated by the Charity Commission.</p>
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>To register as a CASC you must provide facilities for eligible sports and encourage people to take part. Under the new rules from 1 April 2015, at least 50% of members must take part.</p>
<p>You must also:</p>
<li>be set up with a formal constitution, known as a governing document</li>
<li>be open to the whole community and have affordable membership fees</li>
<li>be organised on an amateur basis</li>
<li>be set up and provide facilities in the UK, the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway (but in one country only)</li>
<li>be managed by ‘fit and proper persons’</li>
<h2>Governing document</h2>
<p>This is the document that sets out the purpose and structure of your club. It may also be called a ‘memorandum and articles of association’.</p>
<p>It must:</p>
<li>set out how you meet the eligibility criteria for registering as a CASC</li>
<li>state that any assets left after the club closes are only used by another registered CASC, charity or related community sport</li>
<h2>Open to the whole community</h2>
<p>CASCs must be open to people of all ethnicities, nationalities, sexual orientations, religions or beliefs, sexes, ages and ability - except when a certain level of physical ability is needed to take part in a sport.</p>
<h3>Membership fees</h3>
<p>CASCs can’t charge more than £31 a week for membership, and clubs that charge more than £10 a week must provide help (eg a discount) for people who can’t pay.</p>
<p>You can charge different fees for different types of members, like juniors or students, as long as you’re not discriminating against groups or individuals.</p>
<h2>Organised on an amateur basis</h2>
<p>CASCs must:</p>
<li>not make a profit, unless this is reinvested in the club and spent only on promoting participation and providing facilities for eligible sports</li>
<li>not pay more than £10,000 in total to all players in a year (before 1 April 2015 CASCs couldn’t pay players at all)</li>
<li>provide only the benefits normally associated with an amateur sports club, eg use of equipment, coaching, post-match refreshments</li>
<li>only pay expenses for matches and tours where players take part in and promote the club’s sport (before 1 April 2015 clubs couldn’t pay any expenses)</li>
