Raise a grievance at work
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>If you’re a worker and you’ve tried solving a problem or concern informally by talking to your manager but you’re not satisfied, you can make a formal grievance complaint in writing.</p>
<p>Your employer should have a written grievance procedure that tells you what to do and what happens at each stage of the process. After raising the grievance you’ll have a meeting to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>You can appeal if you do not agree with your employer’s decision.</p>
<p>Read Acas’s guide to discipline and grievances at work.</p>
<p>Mediation can also help resolve a problem - this can take place at any time during the dispute.</p>
<h2>Following the Acas code of practice</h2>
<p>You and your employer should follow the Acas code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you take your claim to an employment tribunal, any compensation you might get could be adjusted by up to 25%.</p>
<h1>Grievance procedure</h1>
<p>Your employer should put their grievance procedure in writing and share it with all staff, such as on the company intranet or in the HR manual.</p>
<p>It should include information about:</p>
<li>how to set out the details of your grievance in writing</li>
<li>who to send your letter to</li>
<li>who to write to if the normal contact person is involved in the grievance</li>
<li>a meeting with your employer to discuss the issue</li>
<li>how to appeal your employer’s decision</li>
<li>how long each stage should take</li>
<h1>Mediation</h1>
<p>Mediation is when an independent, impartial third party discusses a problem with you and your employer (or between you and another employee) to try and find a solution. It’s often used after informal discussions have not solved the issue.</p>
<p>Mediation is voluntary and confidential. The mediator cannot force you or your employer to accept a solution - both parties must agree on the way to solve the dispute.</p>
<p>It should not be used for problems that have to be formally investigated (such as harassment or discrimination).</p>
<p>Read the Acas guide on mediation for more information.</p>
<p>You can find a mediation service in your area.</p>
<h1>Grievance meetings</h1>
<h2>What happens at the meeting</h2>
<p>The aim of the meeting is to establish the facts and find a way to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Your employer will run the meeting. They’ll normally go through the grievance and give the worker the chance to comment. You can bring supporting documents if you want.</p>
<h2>Who can attend meetings with you</h2>
<p>You can be accompanied to grievance meetings (and any appeal meetings) by a:</p>
<li>colleague</li>
<li>trade union representative</li>
<p>You may also be able to bring a family member or Citizens Advice Bureau worker, depending on the HR procedure where you work.</p>
<h2>After the meeting</h2>
<p>Afterwards the employer will write to you setting out their decision along with:</p>
<li>details of any action they intend to take</li>
<li>information about how to appeal</li>
<h1>Appealing a grievance decision</h1>
<p>Your employer’s grievance procedure will set out:</p>
<li>who you should submit your appeal to</li>
<li>the time limit within which an appeal must be made</li>
<li>information about any meetings that will be held</li>
<li>how the appeal meeting will be run</li>
<p>You have the right to be accompanied during any appeal meetings. If possible, a manager who has not been involved in the process should handle the appeal.</p>
<p>After the appeal meeting your employer should write to you setting out their final decision.</p>
