Get an emergency travel document
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>You can apply for an emergency travel document (sometimes called an ‘emergency passport’) if you’re abroad, need to travel and cannot get a passport in time.</p>
<p>If you’re in the UK you should apply for a passport urgently.</p>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>You can apply for an emergency travel document if all the following apply:</p>
<li>you’re a British national</li>
<li>you’re outside the UK</li>
<li>your passport has been lost, stolen, damaged, is full, has recently expired or is with HM Passport Office or a foreign embassy</li>
<li>you do not have time to renew or replace your passport before you travel</li>
<li>you can provide proof of your travel plans, for example booking confirmations (or detailed written travel plans if you cannot book ahead)</li>
<p>You usually cannot get an emergency travel document if you’ve never had a UK passport. You should apply for a passport instead.</p>
<h2>What an emergency travel document lets you do</h2>
<p>You can use an emergency travel document to travel to your destination through a maximum of 5 countries. You can also normally use it to return to the country you’re applying from if you live there.</p>
<p>Your travel plans (countries and dates) will be printed on your emergency travel document. If you change your travel plans once you have your emergency travel document, you’ll need to apply for a new one.</p>
<p>You may need a visa to leave the country you’re in or to travel through other countries with your emergency travel document. Check with the embassy or consulate of each country.</p>
<p>If your final destination is the UK, border staff will keep your emergency travel document when you arrive. Border staff at a different final destination might also keep the document.</p>

<h2>How long it will take</h2>
<p>Your emergency travel document will normally be ready 2 working days after you apply. It may take longer because of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
<p>It can also take longer, for example if you have:</p>
<li>applied for a child under 16</li>
<li>not paid or given the right supporting documents</li>
<li>not given enough or correct information</li>
<p>You’ll be told after you’ve applied how and when you’ll get your emergency travel document.</p>
<h2>Apply on behalf of someone else</h2>
<p>You can apply for an emergency travel document and book an appointment for someone else if they’re a British citizen or British national (overseas). They might have to attend an appointment and they must collect their emergency travel document in person.</p>
<p>If you apply for a child under 16, they’ll need to attend an appointment. Both parents should go with them if possible. If neither parent can attend, they’ll need to send a signed consent letter.</p>
<h1>If you're not a British citizen</h1>
<p>You can apply online if you’re a British national (overseas).</p>
<p>If you’re 16 or over and another type of British national, you need to:</p>
<li>Check if you’re eligible with your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate.</li>
<li>Download and fill in an application form.</li>
<li>Book an appointment with the embassy, high commission or consulate.</li>
<li>Pay the fee at your appointment.</li>
