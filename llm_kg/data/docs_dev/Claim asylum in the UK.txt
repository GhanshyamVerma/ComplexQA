Claim asylum in the UK
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>You must apply for asylum if you want to stay in the UK as a refugee.</p>
<p>To be eligible you must have left your country and be unable to go back because you fear persecution.</p>
<p>Apply for a visa if you want to come to the UK for another reason (for example to work, study or remain with family). If you’re already in the UK and want to remain with family living here, apply for a family of a settled person visa.</p>
<p>You should apply when you arrive in the UK or as soon as you think it would be unsafe for you to return to your own country. Your application is more likely to be denied if you wait.</p>
<p>When you apply you’ll have a meeting with an immigration officer (known as a ‘screening’).</p>
<p>After your screening the Home Office will decide if your claim can be considered in the UK. If it can, you’ll have an asylum interview with a caseworker.</p>
<p>You’ll usually get a decision on your application within 6 months.</p>
<p>You can get up to 2 years in prison or have to leave the UK if you give false information on your application.</p>
<h2>Waiting for your decision</h2>
<p>You’ll be told after your screening what you must do while you’re waiting for your asylum decision, for example report to a caseworker regularly (known as ‘reporting meetings’).</p>
<p>You must tell the authorities if your situation changes.</p>
<p>You will not usually be allowed to work while your asylum claim is being considered.</p>
<h2>Help you can get</h2>
<p>You can get help with:</p>
<li>getting legal representation for your asylum claim</li>
<li>living in the UK while you wait for your decision</li>
<h2>Children applying on their own</h2>
<p>You can apply as a child on your own if you do not have an adult relative who is also claiming asylum.</p>
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>To stay in the UK as a refugee you must be unable to live safely in any part of your own country because you fear persecution there.</p>
<p>If you’re stateless, your own country is the country you usually live in.</p>
<p>This persecution must be because of:</p>
<li>your race</li>
<li>your religion</li>
<li>your nationality</li>
<li>your political opinion</li>
<li>anything else that puts you at risk because of the social, cultural, religious or political situation in your country, for example, your gender, gender identity or sexual orientation</li>
<p>You must have failed to get protection from authorities in your own country.</p>
<h2>When your claim might not be considered</h2>
<p>Your claim might not be considered if you:</p>
<li>are from an EU country</li>
<li>travelled to the UK through a ‘safe third country’</li>
<li>have a connection to a safe third country where you could claim asylum</li>
<p>Generally, a safe third country is one that:</p>
<li>you’re not a citizen of</li>
<li>you would not be harmed in</li>
<li>would not send you on to another country where you would be harmed</li>
<h2>Family members</h2>
<p>You can include your partner and your children under 18 as ‘dependants’ in your application if they’re with you in the UK.</p>
<p>Your children under 18 and your partner can also make their own applications at the same time, but they will not be treated as your dependants.</p>
<h1>Documents you must provide</h1>
<p>You’ll need documents for yourself and your dependants (partner and children under 18) for your asylum screening.</p>
<p>Documents you should bring (if you have them) include:</p>
<li>passports and travel documents</li>
<li>police registration certificates</li>
<li>identification documents, for example identity cards, birth and marriage certificates or school records</li>
<li>anything you think will help your application</li>
<h2>Documents to prove your UK address</h2>
<p>If you’re already in the UK, you and your dependants must bring documents that prove your UK address.</p>
<p>You’ll need different documents depending on whether you’re living in your own accommodation or staying with someone else.</p>
<h3>Living in your own accommodation</h3>
<p>You’ll need to provide documents showing your full name and address. This could be a:</p>
<li>bank statement</li>
<li>housing benefit book</li>
<li>council tax notice</li>
<li>tenancy agreement</li>
<li>household bill</li>
<h3>Staying with someone else</h3>
<p>You’ll need to provide:</p>
<li>a recent letter (less than 3 months old) from the person you’re staying with to confirm you have their permission to stay</li>
<li>documents showing the full name and address of the person you’re staying with, like a council tax notice, tenancy agreement or household bill</li>
<h1>Register your asylum claim</h1>
<p>You register your asylum claim at a ‘screening’. This is a meeting with an immigration officer where you tell them about your case.</p>
<p>You’ll have your screening at the UK border if you claim asylum as soon as you arrive. You can also be screened once you’re in the UK if you become eligible for asylum.</p>
<p>At your screening you’ll:</p>
<li>be photographed</li>
<li>have your fingerprints taken</li>
<li>have an interview to check who you are and where you’re from</li>
<p>You’ll be asked why you want asylum. You can bring written evidence to support your claim if you want, as well as your identification documents.</p>
<p>You’ll need to say if you or your dependants are taking any medication and give any relevant medical information.</p>
<p>You can ask for a male or female interviewer, but your choice might not always be available.</p>
<h2>Screening at the UK border</h2>
<p>You must tell a Border Force officer that you want to claim asylum.</p>
<p>Your application will be registered and you’ll be screened - ask for an interpreter if you need one.</p>
<h2>Screening in the UK</h2>
<p>You must call the asylum intake unit if you’re already in the UK.</p>
<p>They’ll call you back and ask simple questions about you and your family. You will not be asked why you’re claiming asylum during this telephone call.</p>
<p>You’ll be asked if you need help with housing. You might also be asked questions relating to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
<p>The call may take up to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>You do not need to make an appointment if you have nowhere to live - call the asylum intake unit to find out what asylum registration location you should go to and its opening hours.</p>
<p>Tell the asylum intake unit if you need any other dependants on your claim to be present at any stage of your asylum registration, for example the welfare interview, or if you’re a child and need to be accompanied. You can ask to have an interpreter at your screening.</p>
<p>Your appointment might be in a temporary location.</p>
<h3>Attending your appointment</h3>
<p>Because of coronavirus, attend your appointment alone or with any dependants claiming asylum with you.</p>
<p>If you’re helping a child register their own asylum claim, only you can go with them to their appointment.</p>
<p>You must bring the documents you need for your application.</p>
<p>You must also bring any dependants (partner and children under 18) who are claiming asylum with you.</p>
<p>If you show up without an appointment, you may be asked to come back another day.</p>
<p>You cannot get financial help for travel to or from the asylum intake unit.</p>
<p>Tell the appointment service if your situation changes before your appointment date, for example if you can no longer stay where you are living.</p>
<h1>After your screening</h1>
<p>After your screening, the Home Office will review your case and decide whether it can be considered in the UK.</p>
<p>You’ll be sent an asylum registration card (ARC) to your UK address, unless you’ve been detained.</p>
<p>If the Home Office cannot send you an ARC immediately, they’ll send you an appointment letter telling you what to do next.</p>
<p>You might also be sent a ‘preliminary information questionnaire’. If you get one, fill it in and return it by the deadline - the address and deadline are written on the letter that comes with the questionnaire. If you cannot fill it in, call the Home Office asylum team. Their phone number is on the letter.</p>
<p>If your case can be considered in the UK, it will be given to a caseworker.</p>
<h2>If your case cannot be considered in the UK</h2>
<p>You may be sent to a safe country that will consider your asylum claim. This might happen if you’ve travelled to the UK through a safe third country or you have a connection with another country that you could claim asylum in.</p>
<p>Generally, a safe country is one that:</p>
<li>you’re not a citizen of</li>
<li>you would not be harmed in</li>
<li>would not send you on to another country where you would be harmed</li>
<p>The Home Office can decide to send you to a safe country after either your screening or your asylum interview.</p>
<p>If the Home Office cannot place you in another safe country, your case will be considered in the UK and given to a caseworker.</p>
<h2>Caseworkers</h2>
<p>You’ll have an asylum interview with your caseworker. They’ll make a decision about your application.</p>
<p>They’ll also explain the asylum process and tell you what to do while you wait for an asylum decision, such as go to regular reporting meetings.</p>
<p>You may be detained if you do not go to your reporting meetings.</p>
<p>Tell your caseworker if you have any special needs, for example if you have a disability or need medication.</p>
<h2>Your ARC</h2>
<p>The ARC shows you’ve applied for asylum. You can use it to:</p>
<li>show who you are</li>
<li>show whether you have permission to work</li>
<li>get health or education services</li>
<p>You must take your ARC with you when you go to your reporting meetings.</p>
<h3>If you do not have your ARC</h3>
<p>Contact the Home Office using the online form if you have any problems - for example:</p>
<li>you’ve not got your ARC through the post</li>
<li>you’ve lost it</li>
<li>it’s been stolen</li>
<li>it’s expired</li>
<p>You’ll be asked to give your Home Office or port reference number, and your ARC reference (if you know it).</p>
<h2>Being detained</h2>
<p>You may be detained at an immigration removal centre while you wait for a decision on your application.</p>
<p>You’ll either be:</p>
<li>released if you get permission to stay in the UK</li>
<li>held until you’re removed from the UK if you do not get permission to stay</li>
<p>You can also be detained and removed if it’s decided that another country is responsible for offering you asylum.</p>
<p>You may be able to appeal against the decision.</p>
<h3>When you will not be detained</h3>
<p>You will not usually be detained if:</p>
<li>you’re a child</li>
<li>you’re elderly</li>
<li>you’re a family with children</li>
<li>you’re pregnant</li>
<li>you’re accepted as being a victim of trafficking</li>
<li>you’re able to provide independent evidence of torture</li>
<li>you have a mental or physical condition that cannot be managed or would present a risk to others in an immigration removal centre</li>
<h1>Asylum interview</h1>
<p>Your asylum interview will take place soon after your screening.</p>
<p>Your application will usually be rejected if you do not go to your asylum interview.</p>
<p>You’ll get a letter telling you when and where to attend and if any of your dependants also need to be interviewed.</p>
<h2>The interview</h2>
<p>You’ll usually be interviewed alone, without your family members. An interpreter will be provided, if you need one.</p>
<p>The information you provide will be treated in confidence and will not be disclosed to the authorities in your own country.</p>
<p>Use this interview to explain:</p>
<li>how you were persecuted in your country</li>
<li>why you’re afraid to go back to your country</li>
<p>You may be asked questions about difficult topics but it’s important that you explain what has happened to you and your family.</p>
<p>You must tell the caseworker everything you want them to consider or it can count against you.</p>
<p>Bring all the evidence you have of your persecution. You may be asked to send further evidence to your caseworker after the interview, if they think it might help your application.</p>
<p>You should also bring your birth certificate, passport and medical records if you have them.</p>
<p>Your caseworker will make notes in a document called an ‘interview record’. You’ll get a copy of this at the end of the interview.</p>
<h2>Legal representative</h2>
<p>You can bring a legal representative to this interview, for example a lawyer or solicitor. Find out if you can get help paying for legal advice about asylum.</p>
<p>Your interview will take place even if your legal representative is not there. You cannot ask for more time to get a legal representative.</p>
<p>You can ask for this interview to be tape recorded if you do not have legal representation. Ask your caseworker at least one day before.</p>
<h1>Get a decision</h1>
<p>Your application will usually be decided within 6 months. It may take longer if it’s complicated, for example:</p>
<li>your supporting documents need to be verified</li>
<li>you need to attend more interviews</li>
<li>your personal circumstances need to be checked, for example because you have a criminal conviction or you’re currently being prosecuted</li>
<p>Ask your legal adviser if you want an update on your application.</p>
<p>You’ll be given or refused permission to stay in one of the following ways.</p>
<h2>Permission to stay as a refugee</h2>
<p>You and your dependants may be given permission to stay in the UK for 5 years if you qualify for asylum. This is known as ‘leave to remain’.</p>
<p>After 5 years, you can apply to settle in the UK.</p>
<h2>Permission to stay for humanitarian reasons</h2>
<p>You may get permission to stay for humanitarian reasons if you do not qualify for asylum. This means you need to stay in the UK for your protection.</p>
<p>You and your dependants may be given permission to stay in the UK for 5 years. This is known as ‘leave to enter’ or ‘leave to remain’.</p>
<p>After 5 years, you can apply to settle in the UK.</p>
<h2>Permission to stay for other reasons</h2>
<p>You may get permission to stay for other reasons if you do not qualify for permission to stay as a refugee or for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>How long you can stay will depend on your situation.</p>
<p>You may be able to apply to extend your stay or settle in the UK towards the end of your stay.</p>
<h2>No reason to stay</h2>
<p>You’ll be asked to leave the UK if you do not qualify for asylum and your caseworker decides there’s no other reason for you to stay.</p>
<p>You may be able to appeal against the decision.</p>
<p>You’ll have to leave if you do not appeal in the time allowed, or if your appeal is unsuccessful. You can:</p>
<li>leave by yourself - you can get help with returning home</li>
<li>be forced to leave - you’ll get a letter before this happens, then you may be detained without warning at an immigration removal centre and then removed from the UK</li>
<h1>Help you can get</h1>
<p>You can get help from asylum helplines run by charities.</p>
<p>They can help with:</p>
<li>explaining your asylum claim, for example getting a solicitor or lawyer to represent you</li>
<li>living in the UK while your claim is being considered, for example getting asylum support, housing problems, dealing with agencies or finding English language classes and schools</li>
<h2>Legal advice</h2>
<p>You can get legal advice to help your asylum claim.</p>
<h2>Housing and money</h2>
<p>You may also be able to get housing and money (‘asylum support’) to support you and your family. This will only start from the day of your screening if you qualify.</p>
<h2>Help returning home</h2>
<p>You may be able to get help with returning home.</p>
<h1>If you're under 18</h1>
<p>This information is for children applying on their own.</p>
<p>If you have an adult relative who’s claiming asylum you should apply as part of that relative’s application instead.</p>
<h2>You’re not in the care of social services</h2>
<p>You should use the walk-in service at the asylum intake unit.</p>
<h3>If you have an adult who is legally responsible for you</h3>
<p>The adult who is taking responsibility for your care must attend the walk-in service at the asylum intake unit with you.</p>
<p>If you’re living with several relatives the closest blood relative willing to take responsibility for you must attend.</p>
<p>The adult must provide proof of address and photo ID (passport or driving licence).</p>
<h3>If you do not have an adult who is legally responsible for you</h3>
<p>You should go to the police or social services, or you can walk into the asylum intake unit.</p>
<h2>You’re in the care of social services</h2>
<p>You must book an appointment at the asylum intake unit by calling the appointment booking line.</p>
<p>You’ll need the following information when you book your appointment:</p>
<li>your name, date of birth and nationality</li>
<li>the number on your passport or national identity document, if you have one - or the number on your birth certificate if you do not</li>
<li>your foster carer’s name and contact details</li>
<li>details of any medical conditions you have</li>
