Tax on shopping and services
<h1>VAT and duties</h1>
<p>VAT is a tax you pay on most goods and services.</p>
<tr>Rate | % of VAT | What the rate applies to</tr>
<tr>Standard | 20% | Most goods and services</tr>
<tr>Reduced rate | 5% | Some goods and services, for example children’s car seats and some energy-saving materials in the home</tr>
<tr>Zero rate | 0% | Zero-rated goods and services, for example most food and children’s clothes</tr>
<p>Check the VAT rates on different goods and services. Some things are exempt from VAT, such as postage stamps and some financial and property transactions.</p>
<p>VAT is normally included in the price you see in shops, but there are some exceptions.</p>
<h3>VAT and disabled people</h3>
<p>You do not have to pay VAT on certain goods and services if they’re just for your own use and you’re disabled or have a long-term illness.</p>
<h2>Other taxes and duties</h2>
<p>You pay different taxes on:</p>
<li>alcohol and tobacco</li>
<li>petrol, diesel and other fuel</li>
<li>insurance</li>
<li>goods from abroad if you go over your customs allowance</li>
<p>Airlines have to pay air passenger duty for every flight from the UK. Most airline tickets include a separate charge to cover this cost.</p>
<p>Gambling operators (for example, betting shops and websites, casinos or slot machine owners) have to pay gambling duties on profits they make from gambling. Customers do not pay duty on their stake (what they bet or pay to play) or winnings.</p>
<h1>Where you see VAT</h1>
<h2>In shops</h2>
<p>Any VAT due is already included in the price of something you buy in a shop. No tax is added when you pay.</p>
<p>Some shops in Northern Ireland offer tax-free shopping for visitors.</p>
<h2>In adverts, catalogues and price lists</h2>
<p>This depends on who they’re aimed at. If they’re for:</p>
<li>the general public only, they’ll show you a price including VAT</li>
<li>businesses as well as consumers, they might show the price with VAT and without</li>
<li>businesses only they do not usually include VAT, which is charged on top of the price shown</li>
<h2>On bills and receipts</h2>
<p>Sometimes VAT is shown on a separate line. This does not mean you’re paying extra - it just shows how much tax is included in the price.</p>
<p>Invoices from suppliers like builders, painters and decorators must show a separate amount for VAT and their VAT registration number.</p>
<h2>How VAT is worked out</h2>
<p>When someone charges you VAT they multiply their selling price by the VAT rate to calculate the amount of VAT to charge.</p>
<p>They then add this to the selling price to give you the price you actually pay - this is called the ‘gross’ price.</p>
<h1>VAT on energy-saving products</h1>
<p>If you’re eligible, you’ll pay a reduced rate of VAT (5%) when certain energy-saving products are installed in your home.</p>
<p>Your supplier will charge you the reduced rate on the installation and any extra work that’s part of it.</p>
<p>Not all products or installations qualify for the reduced rate and you cannot buy or install them yourself.</p>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>To qualify for the reduced rate, you must be over 60 or getting one or more of the following:</p>
<li>Child Tax Credit (but not the family element)</li>
<li>Council Tax Benefit</li>
<li>Disability Living Allowance</li>
<li>Personal Independence Payment</li>
<li>a disablement pension</li>
<li>Housing Benefit</li>
<li>Jobseeker’s Allowance (income-based)</li>
<li>Income Support</li>
<li>War Disablement Pension</li>
<li>Working Tax Credit</li>
<p>You will also be eligible to get the reduced rate on the products if the total cost of them (not including VAT) is not over 60% of the cost of the installation of the products (not including VAT).</p>
<p>If your products cost more than 60% of the installation, you’ll only be entitled to the reduced rate on the installation.</p>
<p>Your supplier will be responsible for charging you the correct rate of VAT.</p>
<h2>Energy products that qualify</h2>
<p>You pay the reduced rate of 5% for:</p>
<li>controls for central heating and hot water systems</li>
<li>draught stripping, for example insulation fixed around windows and doors to reduce draughts</li>
<li>insulation on walls, floors, ceilings and lofts</li>
<li>solar panels</li>
<li>ground-source heat pumps</li>
<li>air-source heat pumps</li>
<li>micro combined heat and power units</li>
<li>wood-fuelled boilers</li>
<h3>Central heating systems</h3>

<li>installation of heating appliances</li>
<li>installation, repair and maintenance of central heating systems</li>
<li>installation, repair and maintenance of renewable source heating systems</li>
<p>The reduced rate is only for the grant-funded part of the work.</p>

<h1>VAT on mobility aids</h1>
<p>If you’re over 60, you pay a reduced rate of VAT (5%) on certain mobility aids when you pay for them to be supplied and installed in your home.</p>
<h2>Qualifying products</h2>
<p>You can get the reduced rate on:</p>
<li>grab rails</li>
<li>ramps</li>
<li>stair lifts</li>
<li>bath lifts</li>
<li>built-in shower seats or showers containing built-in shower seats</li>
<li>walk-in baths with sealable doors</li>
<p>You do not get the reduced rate if you repair or replace the goods after they’ve been installed.</p>
<p>You do not have to order and pay for the product yourself - a friend, local council, charity or housing association can do it for you.</p>
<h2>How to get the reduced rate</h2>
<p>Your supplier should know about the reduced rate and apply it. You qualify if:</p>
<li>you’re over 60 when the product is supplied or installed</li>
<li>the product is installed - you do not get the reduced rate if you just buy it</li>
<li>the product is for a private home, for example your own home or one shared with friends or relatives (a residential care home does not qualify)</li>
<p>You’ll need to confirm to your supplier in writing that you meet these conditions. They may give you a form, or you can sign your own declaration. Ask a relative, partner or other responsible person if you’re not able to fill it in yourself.</p>
<h3>Declaration: mobility aids for older people</h3>
<p>Sign and date the declaration, using this standard wording.</p>
<h2>Help from your council</h2>
<p>If you need to adapt your home because of old age you can apply to your council for equipment or help.</p>
<h1>Tax-free shopping</h1>
<p>You can only buy tax-free goods from shops in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) if they’re delivered straight to an address outside the UK. Check with the retailer if they offer this service.</p>
<p>You may be able to buy tax-free goods from some shops when you visit Northern Ireland. You claim your VAT refund when you leave Northern Ireland or the EU.</p>
<h2>When you may be able to get a VAT refund</h2>
<p>You can sometimes get VAT refunds on goods you buy in Northern Ireland if you:</p>
<li>visit Northern Ireland and live outside the UK and EU</li>
<li>work or study in Northern Ireland but normally live outside the UK and EU</li>
<li>live in Northern Ireland but are leaving the UK and EU for at least 12 months</li>
<p>You can only get a VAT refund if you take the goods out of Northern Ireland and the EU within 3 months of buying them. Not all retailers offer VAT refunds.</p>
<h3>Taking goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h3>
<p>You will not get a VAT refund if you travel straight from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.</p>
<p>If you travel from Northern Ireland to Great Britain through another country, the goods will count towards your tax-free personal allowances. You may have to declare them along with other goods you’re carrying when you enter Great Britain and pay import VAT.</p>
<p>This may mean you have to pay VAT again on the goods from Northern Ireland. If this happens, you can get a refund of the overpaid VAT from the retailer.</p>
<p>Check the rules on bringing goods into Great Britain.</p>
<h2>How to get a VAT refund</h2>
<li>Get a VAT 407 form from the retailer - they might ask for proof that you’re eligible, for example your passport.</li>
<li>Show the goods, the completed form and your receipts to customs at the point when you leave Northern Ireland or the EU.</li>
<li>Customs will approve your form if everything is in order. You then take the approved form to get paid.</li>
<p>If you’re changing planes in an EU country and checking your goods with your luggage, you must do step 2 in Northern Ireland when you check in.</p>
<h3>Getting paid</h3>
<p>You can either get paid immediately at a refund booth, for example at the airport, or send the approved form to the retailer or their refund company. The retailer will tell you how you’ll get paid.</p>
<p>Some retailers charge a fee for handling your form. This money will be deducted from your refund.</p>
<p>If there are no customs officials available, you can leave your form in a customs post box. Customs will check it and contact your retailer to arrange the refund if everything is in order.</p>
<h2>Goods you cannot get a refund for</h2>
<p>You cannot get a VAT refund for:</p>
<li>mail order goods, including internet sales, delivered outside of Northern Ireland</li>
<li>goods you’ve already used in Northern Ireland or the EU, such as perfume</li>
<li>service charges, such as hotel bills</li>
<li>new or used cars</li>
<li>goods worth more than £600 exported for business purposes</li>
<li>goods to be exported as freight</li>
