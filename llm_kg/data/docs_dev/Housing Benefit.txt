Housing Benefit
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>Housing Benefit can help you pay your rent if you’re unemployed, on a low income or claiming benefits. It’s being replaced by Universal Credit.</p>
<p>You can only make a new claim for Housing Benefit if either of the following apply:</p>
<li>you have reached State Pension age</li>
<li>you’re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing</li>
<h2>You’ve reached State Pension age</h2>
<p>If you’re single you can make a new claim for Housing Benefit.</p>
<h3>If you’re over State Pension age and live with your partner</h3>
<p>You can make a new claim for Housing Benefit if any of the following apply:</p>
<li>you and your partner have both reached State Pension age</li>
<li>one of you has reached State Pension age and started claiming Pension Credit (for you as a couple) before 15 May 2019</li>
<li>you’re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing</li>
<h3>If you’re over State Pension age and have an existing claim</h3>
<p>Your existing claim will not be affected if, before 15 May 2019, you:</p>
<li>were getting Housing Benefit</li>
<li>had reached State Pension age</li>
<p>It does not matter if your partner is under State Pension age.</p>
<p>If your circumstances change and your Housing Benefit is stopped, you cannot start getting it again unless you and your partner are eligible to make a new claim.</p>
<p>You can apply for Universal Credit if you’re not eligible.</p>
<h2>If you’re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing</h2>
<p>You can make a new claim if:</p>
<li>you’re living in temporary accommodation, such as a B&B arranged by your council</li>
<li>you’re living in a refuge for survivors of domestic abuse</li>
<li>you’re living in sheltered or supported housing (such as a hostel) which provides you with ‘care, support or supervision’</li>
<p>If you do not get ‘care, support or supervision’ through your supported or sheltered housing, you can apply for Universal Credit to help with housing costs.</p>
<p>If you’re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing, you can apply for Universal Credit to help with other living costs.</p>
<h2>When you may not be able to claim</h2>
<p>Usually, you will not get Housing Benefit if:</p>
<li>your savings are over £16,000 - unless you get Guarantee Credit of Pension Credit</li>
<li>you’re paying a mortgage on your own home - you may be able to get Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI)</li>
<li>you live in the home of a close relative</li>
<li>you’re already claiming Universal Credit (unless you’re in temporary or supported housing)</li>
<li>you live with your partner and they are already claiming Housing Benefit</li>
<li>you’re a full-time student</li>
<li>you’re residing in the UK as a European Economic Area jobseeker</li>
<li>you’re an asylum seeker or sponsored to be in the UK</li>
<li>you’re subject to immigration control and your granted leave states that you cannot claim public funds</li>
<li>you’re a Crown Tenant</li>
<li>you’ve reached State Pension age but your live-in partner has not - unless you had an existing claim as a couple before 15 May 2019</li>
<p>You may be able to get other help with housing costs.</p>
<p>If not, you’ll need to claim Universal Credit instead.</p>
<p>Use a benefits calculator to check if you can get Housing Benefit before you apply</p>
<h1>What you'll get</h1>
<p>You may get help with all or part of your rent. There’s no set amount of Housing Benefit and what you get will depend on whether you rent privately or from a council.</p>
<p>Use a benefits calculator to work out what you could get or check what extra help is available.</p>
<h2>Council and social housing rent</h2>
<p>How much you get depends on:</p>
<li>your ‘eligible’ rent</li>
<li>if you have a spare room</li>
<li>your household income - including benefits, pensions and savings (over £6,000)</li>
<li>your circumstances, for example the age of people in the house or if someone has a disability</li>
<h3>Eligible rent</h3>
<p>Your eligible rent is the amount used to calculate your Housing Benefit claim. It’s your actual rent plus any service charges you have to pay (such as for lift maintenance or a communal laundry) but not things like heating or water costs for your home.</p>
<h3>Spare bedrooms</h3>
<p>Your Housing Benefit could be reduced if you live in council or social housing and have a spare  bedroom. The reduction is:</p>
<li>14% of the ‘eligible rent’ for 1 spare bedroom</li>
<li>25% of the ‘eligible rent’ for 2 or more spare bedrooms</li>
<h3>Sharing bedrooms</h3>
<p>The following are expected to share:</p>
<li>an adult couple</li>
<li>2 children under 16 of the same sex</li>
<li>2 children under 10 (regardless of sex)</li>
<p>The following can have their own bedroom:</p>
<li>a single adult (16 or over)</li>
<li>a child that would normally share but shared bedrooms are already taken, for example you have 3 children and 2 already share</li>
<li>a couple or children who cannot share because of a disability or medical condition</li>
<li>an overnight carer for you, your partner, your child or another adult - this is only if the carer does not live with you but sometimes has to stay overnight</li>
<p>One spare bedroom is allowed for:</p>
<li>an approved foster carer who is between placements but only for up to 52 weeks from the end of the last placement</li>
<li>a newly approved foster carer for up to 52 weeks from the date of approval if no child is placed with them during that time</li>
<p>Rooms used by students and members of the armed or reserve forces will not be counted as ‘spare’ if they’re away and intend to return home.</p>
<h2>Private rent</h2>
<p>If you rent privately, your eligible rent amount is either your Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rate or your actual rent, whichever is lower. The LHA rate is based on:</p>
<li>where you live</li>
<li>your household size - find out how many bedrooms you’re eligible for</li>
<h3>How much you can get</h3>
<p>How much you get depends on:</p>
<li>the lower figure of your ‘eligible’ rent or LHA rate</li>
<li>your household income including benefits, pensions and savings (over £6,000)</li>
<li>your circumstances (for example your age or whether you have a disability)</li>
<p>Contact your local council if you’re living in:</p>
<li>a houseboat or a mooring</li>
<li>a caravan site</li>
<li>a room with any meals included in the rent (sometimes known as a boarding home)</li>
<li>a hostel</li>
<li>a Rent Act protected property</li>
<h3>Exception</h3>
<p>If you’ve been getting Housing Benefit since before 7 April 2008, these limits only apply if you:</p>
<li>change address</li>
<li>have a break in your claim for Housing Benefit</li>
<h2>How you’re paid</h2>
<p>The way you get paid Housing Benefit by your council depends on the type of tenant you are.</p>
<p>If you’re a:</p>
<li>council tenant, it’s paid into your rent account (you will not receive the money)</li>
<li>private or housing association tenant, it’s paid into your bank or building society account (rarely by cheque)</li>
<h2>The benefit cap</h2>
<p>The benefit cap limits the total amount of benefit you can get. It applies to most people aged 16 or over who have not reached State Pension age.</p>
<p>If you’re affected, your Housing Benefit will go down to make sure that the total amount of benefit you get is not more than the cap level. Use the benefit cap calculator to find out how the benefit cap affects you.</p>
<h2>Appeal a Housing Benefit decision</h2>
<p>Contact your local council to appeal a Housing Benefit decision.</p>
<h1>Supporting your claim</h1>
<p>You’ll need to provide some information and evidence to support your claim for Housing Benefit.</p>
<p>You’ll get Housing Benefit faster if you have this available when you make your claim.</p>
<p>You’ll need to know:</p>
<li>how much rent you pay</li>
<li>whether anything else is included in the rent, such as water, gas or electricity charges</li>
<li>if you pay any service charges, including building maintenance or insurance</li>
<li>your landlord or agent’s details</li>
<h3>Special types of tenancy</h3>
<p>If your current tenancy started in 1997 or earlier and you rent from a private landlord, you’ll need to know if you have an ‘assured tenancy’. You can check your tenancy on the Shelter website.</p>
<p>If you live in and pay rent for a government property (a ‘Crown Tenant’), you’re not entitled to Housing Benefit. This includes armed forces living in service family accommodation (SFA).</p>
<h2>Evidence you’ll have to provide</h2>
<p>You’ll need to provide original documents, not copies. The supporting evidence you’ll need includes:</p>
<li>your most recent payslips (5 if paid weekly, or 2 if paid monthly)</li>
<li>bank or building society statements for the last 2 full months</li>
<li>proof of other income or investments, including shares, ISAs or Premium Bonds</li>
<li>proof of income for any non-dependants living with you, such as adult relatives or friends</li>
<p>You’ll also need proof of your partner’s name and address. You cannot use the same document to prove both their name and address.</p>
<p>Provide any 2 of the following:</p>
<li>UK photocard driving licence</li>
<li>current passport</li>
<li>birth or marriage certificate</li>
<li>biometric residence permit</li>
<li>certificate of registration or naturalisation</li>
<li>permanent residence card</li>
<li>letter from HMRC or the Home Office</li>
<li>recent utility bill</li>
<li>recent bank or building society statement</li>
<li>recent benefit award statements</li>
<h3>If you rent from a private landlord</h3>
<p>You’ll also need to provide one of the following:</p>
<li>a tenancy agreement or rent book</li>
<li>a letter from your landlord confirming your tenancy - this is usually supplied at the start of your tenancy</li>
<h1>How to claim</h1>
<p>Housing Benefit is being replaced by Universal Credit. Most people will need to claim Universal Credit instead.</p>
<p>Check if you’re eligible for Housing Benefit before you apply.</p>
<p>You can either apply:</p>
<li>through your local council</li>
<li>as part of a Pension Credit claim, if you’re eligible for this</li>
<p>You’ll need to provide evidence to support your Housing Benefit claim.</p>
<h2>If you’re applying for Pension Credit</h2>
<p>You can apply for Housing Benefit as part of your Pension Credit application.</p>
<p>Apply for Pension Credit online or contact the Pension Service to claim.</p>
<p>The Pension Service will send details of your claim for Housing Benefit to your council.</p>
<h2>Claiming in advance and backdating</h2>
<p>You can claim in advance by up to 13 weeks (or 17 weeks if you’re aged 60 or over), for example if you’re moving. You will not usually get any money before you move.</p>
<p>You might also be able to get your claim backdated - ask your council.</p>
<h2>Appeal a decision</h2>
<p>You can ask your council for a Housing Benefit decision to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>If you’re unhappy with the response you can appeal the decision.</p>
<h1>Report a change of circumstances</h1>
<p>You need to report a change of circumstances for you and anyone else in your house.</p>
<p>Your claim might be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change of circumstances straight away.</p>
<p>Changes can include:</p>
<li>starting or stopping work, education, training or an apprenticeship</li>
<li>changes to the benefits you or anyone else in your house gets</li>
<li>changes to your personal or workplace pension</li>
<li>changes to your savings, investments or property</li>
<li>your income going up or down</li>
<li>moving house</li>
<li>your rent going up or down</li>
<li>going abroad for any length of time</li>
<li>going into hospital, a care home or sheltered accommodation</li>
<li>people moving into or out of your house (for example your partner, a child or lodger)</li>
<li>having a baby</li>
<li>your partner or someone you live with dying</li>
<li>your child turning 18</li>
<li>changes to your immigration status, if you’re not a British citizen</li>
<p>Contact your council if you’re not sure whether you need to report a change.</p>
<h2>How to report</h2>
<p>Report a change of circumstances to your council.</p>
<h2>If you receive other benefits</h2>
<p>You need to report a change of circumstances for all benefits you receive.</p>
<h3>If your other benefits stop</h3>
<p>Some benefits stop if you go back to work, work more hours or earn more money.</p>
<p>If this happens, your council might:</p>
<li>give you an extra 4 weeks of housing benefit (‘Extended Payment of Housing Benefit’)</li>
<li>start paying you an ‘in-work Housing Benefit’</li>
<p>You do not have to claim - your council will decide if you’re eligible for help and write to let you know.</p>
<h2>If you’ve been paid too much</h2>
<p>You may have to repay the money if you:</p>
<li>did not report a change straight away</li>
<li>gave wrong information</li>
<li>were overpaid by mistake</li>
<p>Find out how to repay the money you owe from benefit overpayment.</p>
<h1>Other help with housing costs</h1>
<p>Housing Benefit will not cover heating, hot water, energy or food. If you need help, use a benefits calculator to see what else you might be entitled to.</p>
<h2>Extra help to pay the rent</h2>
<p>You could also apply for extra help from your council if your Housing Benefit does not cover your rent. This is called a Discretionary Housing Payment.</p>
