<h2>Gift Aid declaration forms</h2>

<li>name of your charity or community amateur sports club (CASC)</li>
<li>donor’s full name</li>
<li>donor’s home address (at least their house number or name and postcode)</li>
<h3>Example declarations</h3>

<h2>Cash donations</h2>
<p>You can put a Gift Aid declaration on your charity’s collection envelopes.</p>
<p>You may still be able to claim on cash donations of £30 or less if you do not have a declaration.</p>
<h1>Small donations scheme</h1>
<p>You may be able to claim 25% on:</p>
<li>cash donations of £30 or less</li>
<li>contactless card donations of £30 or less collected on or after 6 April 2019</li>
<p>This is called the Gift Aid small donations scheme (GASDS). You do not need a Gift Aid declaration to claim.</p>
<p>From 6 April 2016, you can claim up to £2,000 in a tax year or £1,250 for earlier years.</p>
<h2>Who can claim</h2>
<p>Your charity or CASC must have claimed Gift Aid:</p>
<li>in the same tax year as you want to claim GASDS</li>
<li>without getting a penalty in the last 2 tax years</li>
<li>in at least 2 of the last 4 tax years (without a 2-year gap between claims) if you’re claiming on donations made before 6 April 2017</li>
<h2>What you can claim</h2>
<p>Your GASDS claim cannot be more than 10 times your Gift Aid claim. For example, you can claim on £1,000 worth of donations through GASDS if you’ve received £100 of Gift Aid donations in the same tax year.</p>
<p>You can claim on donations that are eligible for Gift Aid, but not membership fees.</p>
<h3>Collections in community buildings</h3>
<p>If your charity has a community building (for example a village hall or religious building) you might be able to claim more on donations collected either:</p>
<li>in your community building</li>
<li>in the same council area as your community building, if you collected the donations on or after 6 April 2017</li>
<p>For somewhere to count as your community building, you need to have hosted at least 6 charity events there. The events must have all been attended by at least 10 people.</p>
<h3>If your organisation is connected to another charity or CASC</h3>
<p>If one of the charities has a community building, all of the connected charities can either:</p>
<li>claim as if they had a community building</li>
<li>share a single £8,000 limit - all the charities will need to write to HMRC to do this</li>
<p>If none of the charities have a community building, or you’re claiming for donations made before 6 April 2017, the connected charities must share a single £8,000 limit.</p>
<p>If your charity has merged with another charity or CASC you may be able to take on the other charity’s record of good claims.</p>
<h2>Keeping records</h2>
<p>You need to record the:</p>
<li>total cash donations collected</li>
<li>date of the collection</li>
<li>date it was paid into a bank account</li>
<p>You’ll need to keep records of any contactless card donations that you’ve taken, for example receipts from your card machine.</p>
<p>For collections in community buildings you’ll also need to record:</p>
<li>the address of the place you collected the donations (including postcode)</li>
<li>the type of event</li>
<li>the number of events you held</li>
<li>an estimate of how many people were at the event</li>
