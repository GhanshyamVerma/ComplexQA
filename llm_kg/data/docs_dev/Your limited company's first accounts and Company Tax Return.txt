Your limited company's first accounts and Company Tax Return
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>When you set up your limited company, you automatically get different reporting dates for the first:</p>
<li>annual accounts you send to Companies House</li>
<li>Company Tax Return you send to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)</li>
<p>You may also have to send (‘file’) 2 tax returns to cover your first year in business.</p>
<h3>Annual accounts</h3>
<p>Your first accounts usually cover more than 12 months. This is because they:</p>
<li>start on the day your company was set up (‘incorporated’)</li>
<li>end on the ‘accounting reference date’ that Companies House sets for the end of your company’s financial year - this is the last day of the month your company was set up</li>
<h3>Company Tax Return</h3>
<p>The period covered by your tax return (your ‘accounting period’ for Corporation Tax) can’t be longer than 12 months. So you may have to file 2 tax returns to cover the period of your first accounts. If you do, you’ll also have 2 payment deadlines.</p>
<p>In following years you then normally only file one tax return - and it will usually cover the same financial year as your accounts.</p>
<h2>What you must do</h2>
<p>The dates of your first tax return - and whether you file 2 or one - depend on whether your company:</p>
<li>started trading on the same day it was set up</li>
<li>didn’t start trading until after it was set up</li>
<h1>You started trading the day your company set up</h1>
<p>File 2 Company Tax Returns if your company started trading on the same day it was set up - one for your company’s first 12 months and one for the rest of the time covered by your company’s first accounts.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<tr>Action | Date</tr>
<tr>Company set up and started trading | 11 May 2013</tr>
<tr>First accounting period for Corporation Tax ends | 10 May 2014</tr>
<tr>Accounting reference date | 31 May 2014</tr>
<tr>Second accounting period for Corporation Tax ends | 31 May 2014</tr>
<p>Prepare your first set of accounts for 11 May 2013 to 31 May 2014. Then file your:</p>
<li>first tax return for 11 May 2013 to 10 May 2014</li>
<li>second tax return for 11 to 31 May 2014</li>
<p>After you do this, your accounts and tax returns will normally cover your company’s financial year from 1 June to 31 May.</p>
<h1>You started trading after your company set up</h1>
<p>Limited companies can be ‘dormant’ for Corporation Tax between setting up (‘incorporating’) and starting to trade for the first time.</p>
<p>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has detailed guidance on what counts as dormant for Corporation Tax.</p>
<p>You tell HMRC the date that you started to trade when you register for Corporation Tax.</p>
<p>What you have to do if your company was dormant depends on whether you registered for Corporation Tax before your accounting reference date.</p>
<h2>You registered for Corporation Tax before your accounting reference date</h2>
<p>You usually:</p>
<li>don’t file a tax return for the period you were dormant</li>
<li>prepare your first tax return to cover the period you were trading</li>
<p>File 2 tax returns if you were trading for more than 12 months - one for the first 12 months of trading and one for the rest of the time.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<tr>Action | Date</tr>
<tr>Company set up | 11 May 2013</tr>
<tr>Started trading | 22 July 2013</tr>
<tr>Register for Corporation Tax | 26 August 2013</tr>
<tr>Accounting reference date | 31 May 2014</tr>
<p>Prepare accounts for 11 May 2013 to 31 May 2014. Then file one tax return for your trading period from 22 July 2013 to 31 May 2014.</p>
<p>After you do this, your dates for accounts and tax returns will normally match your company’s financial year from 1 June to 31 May every year.</p>
<p>Check the ‘notice to deliver a Company Tax Return’ you get after your first year. If it covers your dormant and trading periods you must file 2 tax returns - one for your trading period and one for your dormant period.</p>
<h2>You didn’t register for Corporation Tax before your accounting reference date</h2>
<p>You must file 2 tax returns - one for the period you were dormant and one for the period you were trading.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<tr>Action | Date</tr>
<tr>Company set up | 11 May 2013</tr>
<tr>Started trading | 22 July 2013</tr>
<tr>Accounting reference date | 31 May 2014</tr>
<p>Prepare one set of accounts for 11 May 2013 to 31 May 2014. Then file your:</p>
<li>first tax return for your dormant period from 11 May to 21 July 2013</li>
<li>second tax return for your trading period from 22 July 2013 to 31 May 2014</li>
<p>After you do this, your dates for accounts and tax returns will normally match your company’s financial year from 1 June to 31 May every year.</p>
