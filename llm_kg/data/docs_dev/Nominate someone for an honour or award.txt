Nominate someone for an honour or award
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The honours system recognises people who have:</p>
<li>made achievements in public life</li>
<li>committed themselves to serving and helping Britain</li>
<p>They’ll usually have made life better for other people or be outstanding at what they do.</p>
<p>They must still be actively involved in what you’re nominating them for. The only honours which can be awarded after someone’s death are gallantry awards.</p>
<p>Whether someone gets an honour - and the honour they get - is decided by an honours committee. The committee’s recommendations go to the Prime Minister and then to the Queen, who awards the honour.</p>
<h2>Nominating someone for an honour</h2>
<p>Anyone can nominate someone for an honour.</p>
<p>How you apply depends on whether you want to:</p>

<li>nominate someone for their work in responding to coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
<li>nominate someone overseas</li>
<li>nominate someone for a gallantry award</li>
<h2>After you nominate someone for an honour</h2>
<p>You’ll get an acknowledgment - but you may not hear anything else for 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>All nominees will be checked by various government departments to make sure they’re suitable for an honour. This may include checks by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
<p>The honours committee reviews those nominations that are sent to it.</p>

<p>An award given by the Queen - usually to people who have helped her personally, like members of the Royal household staff or British ambassadors.</p>
