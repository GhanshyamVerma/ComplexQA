Become a special guardian
<h1>What is a special guardian</h1>
<p>You can apply to be a child’s special guardian when they cannot live with their birth parents and adoption is not right for them.</p>
<p>You’ll be responsible for looking after the child until they’re 18 (unless the court takes your responsibility away earlier).</p>
<p>You’ll make all day to day decisions about the child, for example schooling and medical treatment. You do not have to discuss these decisions with the birth parents.</p>
<p>You’ll need to get the consent of everyone who has parental responsibility for the child before you make some important decisions, for example:</p>
<li>changing the child’s surname</li>
<li>putting the child up for adoption</li>
<li>taking the child abroad for more than 3 months</li>
<li>the child having surgery for reasons other than improving health, such as circumcision, sterilisation or cosmetic surgery</li>
<p>If you cannot get consent, you can ask the court to decide. Use the form ‘Make an application in existing court proceedings related to children’ (form C2).</p>
<h1>Who can apply</h1>
<p>You can apply to be a child’s special guardian if you’re not their parent and you’re over 18.</p>
<p>You can make an application with someone else. This is known as a joint claim.</p>
<p>You and anyone you’re applying with can apply if:</p>
<li>you’re already the child’s legal guardian</li>
<li>the child lives with you because of a child arrangements order</li>
<li>the child has lived with you for 3 of the past 5 years</li>
<li>you’re the child’s relative or a foster parent, and the child has been living with you for at least 1 year</li>
<li>you have the agreement of anyone named in a child arrangements order as someone who the child will live with</li>
<li>you have the agreement of all the people with parental responsibility for the child</li>
<li>you have the agreement of the local council, if the child is in care</li>
<p>If you do not fit one of these descriptions, you’ll need to ask the court’s permission to apply. You’ll need to send the following forms to your local family court:</p>
<li>‘Make an application in existing court proceedings relating to children’ (form C2)</li>
<li>‘Family mediation and assessment meeting’ (form FM1)</li>
<h1>Apply</h1>
<p>You can use a family mediator to help make arrangements with the child’s family to avoid having to apply to the court.</p>
<p>It costs £215 to apply to the court. You may be able to get help with court fees if you’re on benefits or a low income.</p>
<h2>Before you apply</h2>
<p>Three months before you apply to become a special guardian you need to tell your local council in writing that you plan to make an application.</p>
<p>You also need to tell anyone named in existing court proceedings or orders about the child that you plan to make an application.</p>
<h2>Applying to the court</h2>
<p>Fill in these forms and send them to your local family court:</p>
<li>an ‘Application for an order’ (form C1)</li>
<li>a supporting statement (form C13A)</li>
<li>a ‘Family mediation information and assessment meeting’ form (FM1) to show you’ve been through mediation or why you could not go</li>
<p>Make copies of your completed forms before you send your application to the court. You’ll need to send these copies to each person affected by the application after you apply.</p>
<p>Find your local family court.</p>
<h3>If you want to keep your details private</h3>
<p>You can apply to keep your and the child’s contact details private throughout the court proceedings.</p>
<p>Fill in ‘Apply to keep your contact details confidential from other parties in family proceedings’ (form C8) and send it with your application.</p>
<h1>After you apply</h1>
<p>Within 10 days of receiving your application the court will send you a case number and a date for a meeting to set out:</p>
<li>a timetable for your case</li>
<li>how it will be dealt with</li>
<p>This meeting is called a ‘first directions hearing’.</p>
<p>You must go to all hearings you’re told to unless the court excuses you. If you’re not able to go, contact the court office.</p>
<h2>Contact people in the child’s life</h2>
<p>You must send the date and location of the hearing along with copies of your application to everyone with parental responsibility for the child.</p>
<p>If there is a current care order about the child, you should also send details of the hearing and copies of your application to:</p>
<li>everyone you believe had parental responsibility before the current court-made care order</li>
<li>the court-appointed Cafcass children’s guardian</li>
<p>You must also tell the following people and organisations that you’ve applied:</p>
<li>the children’s services department of your local council or the council local to where the child is staying, if that is different</li>
<li>everyone who cares for the child</li>
<li>the home where the child stays if it is a registered children’s home or a voluntary home and it is a refuge</li>
<li>everyone the child has lived with for at least 3 years before you made the application</li>
<li>anyone else named in a current court order</li>
<li>anyone involved in any other ongoing proceedings that might be affected by your application</li>
<h2>The final hearing</h2>
<p>The court will decide if a special guardianship order is in the best interests of the child after looking at all the evidence, and in some cases, hearing from witnesses.</p>
<p>If the court agrees, they will send the final order to you and the other people involved in the case, including the birth parents.</p>
<h2>Financial help for special guardians</h2>
<p>You might be able to get a special guardian allowance from the children’s services department of your local council.</p>
