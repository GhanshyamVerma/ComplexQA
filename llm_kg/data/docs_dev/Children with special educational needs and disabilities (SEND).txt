Children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) can affect a child or young person’s ability to learn. They can affect their:</p>
<li>behaviour or ability to socialise, for example they struggle to make friends</li>
<li>reading and writing, for example because they have dyslexia</li>
<li>ability to understand things</li>
<li>concentration levels, for example because they have ADHD</li>
<li>physical ability</li>
<h2>Who to talk to</h2>
<p>If you think your child may have special educational needs, contact the SEN co-ordinator, or ‘SENCO’ in your child’s school or nursery.</p>
<p>Contact your local council if your child is not in a school or nursery.</p>
<p>Your local Information, Advice and Support (IAS) Service can give you advice about SEND.</p>
<h2>Support your child can receive</h2>
<p>Your child may be eligible for:</p>
<li>SEN support - support given in school, like speech therapy</li>
<li>an education, health and care (EHC) plan - a plan of care for children and young people aged up to 25 who have more complex needs</li>
<p>If you or your child got support before September 2014 this will continue until your local council changes it to an EHC plan.</p>
<h1>Special educational needs support</h1>
<p>Your child will get SEN support at their school or college.</p>
<p>Your child may need an education, health and care (EHC) plan if they need more support than their school provides.</p>
<h2>Children under 5</h2>
<p>SEN support for children under 5 includes:</p>
<li>a written progress check when your child is 2 years old</li>
<li>a child health visitor carrying out a health check for your child if they’re aged 2 to 3</li>
<li>a written assessment in the summer term of your child’s first year of primary school</li>
<li>making reasonable adjustments for disabled children, like providing aids like tactile signs</li>
<p>Nurseries, playgroups and childminders registered with Ofsted follow the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework. The framework makes sure that there’s support in place for children with SEND.</p>
<p>Talk to a doctor or health adviser if you think your child has SEND but they do not go to a nursery, playgroup or childminder. They’ll tell you what support options are available.</p>
<h2>Children between 5 and 15</h2>
<p>Talk to the teacher or the SEN co-ordinator (SENCO) if you think your child needs:</p>
<li>a special learning programme</li>
<li>extra help from a teacher or assistant</li>
<li>to work in a smaller group</li>
<li>observation in class or at break</li>
<li>help taking part in class activities</li>
<li>extra encouragement in their learning, for example to ask questions or to try something they find difficult</li>
<li>help communicating with other children</li>
<li>support with physical or personal care difficulties, for example eating, getting around school safely or using the toilet</li>
<h2>Young people aged 16 or over in further education</h2>
<p>Contact the college before your child starts further education to make sure that they can meet your child’s needs.</p>
<p>The college and your local authority will talk to your child about the support they need.</p>
<h1>Extra help</h1>
<p>An education, health and care (EHC) plan is for children and young people aged up to 25 who need more support than is available through special educational needs support.</p>
<p>EHC plans identify educational, health and social needs and set out the additional support to meet those needs.</p>
<h2>Requesting an EHC assessment</h2>
<p>You can ask your local authority to carry out an assessment if you think your child needs an EHC plan.</p>
<p>A young person can request an assessment themselves if they’re aged 16 to 25.</p>
<p>A request can also be made by anyone else who thinks an assessment may be necessary, including doctors, health visitors, teachers, parents and family friends.</p>
<p>If they decide to carry out an assessment you may be asked for:</p>
<li>any reports from your child’s school, nursery or childminder</li>
<li>doctors’ assessments of your child</li>
<li>a letter from you about your child’s needs</li>
<p>The local authority will tell you within 16 weeks whether an EHC plan is going to be made for your child.</p>
<h2>Creating an EHC plan</h2>
<li>Your local authority will create a draft EHC plan and send you a copy.</li>
<li>You have 15 days to comment, including if you want to ask that your child goes to a specialist needs school or specialist college.</li>
<li>Your local authority has 20 weeks from the date they receive the request for the assessment to give you the final EHC plan.</li>
<h2>Disagreeing with a decision</h2>
<p>You can challenge your local authority about:</p>
<li>their decision to not carry out an assessment</li>
<li>their decision to not create an EHC plan</li>
<li>the special educational support in the EHC plan</li>
<li>the school named in the EHC plan</li>
<p>If you cannot resolve the problem with your local authority, you can appeal to the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Tribunal.</p>
<h2>Personal budgets</h2>
<p>You may be able to get a personal budget for your child if they have an EHC plan or have been told that they need one.</p>
<p>It allows you to have a say in how to spend the money on support for your child.</p>
<p>There are 3 ways you can use your personal budget. You can have:</p>
<li>direct payments made into your account - you buy and manage services yourself</li>
<li>an arrangement with your local authority or school where they hold the money for you but you still decide how to spend it (sometimes called ‘notional arrangements’)</li>
<li>third-party arrangements - you choose someone else to manage the money for you</li>
<p>You can have a combination of all 3 options.</p>
<h2>Independent support for children of all ages</h2>
<p>Independent supporters can help you and your child through the new SEN assessment process, including:</p>
<li>replacing a statement of special educational needs with a new EHC plan</li>
<li>moving a child from a learning difficulty assessment (LDA) to an EHC plan</li>
<p>You can find out how to get local support through:</p>
<li>Council for Disabled Children</li>
<li>Information, Advice and Support Service Network</li>
<li>your local authority website and search for ‘Local Offer’</li>
<h1>If your child got support before September 2014</h1>
<p>Your child will move to an education, health and care (EHC) plan. This will normally happen at a planned review, or when your child moves school. Your council will tell you which.</p>
<p>Your child will already be getting SEN support if they used to get help through:</p>
<li>School Action or School Action Plus</li>
<li>Early Years Action or Early Years Action Plus</li>
<h2>Support after your child leaves school</h2>
<p>If your child has a statement of special educational needs, they’ll have a ‘transition plan’ drawn up in Year 9. This helps to plan for their future after they leave school.</p>
<p>They’ll continue to get support during further education. Your child can also ask for an EHC assessment if they need more help than the school or college can provide.</p>
<h2>Help and advice</h2>
<p>You can call the Contact a Family helpline for help and advice.</p>
<p>You can also get help from Independent Parental Special Education Advice (IPSEA).</p>
