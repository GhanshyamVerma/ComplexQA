Attendance Allowance
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Attendance Allowance helps with extra costs if you have a disability severe enough that you need someone to help look after you.</p>
<p>This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).</p>
<p>It’s paid at 2 different rates and how much you get depends on the level of care that you need because of your disability.</p>
<p>You could get £60 or £89.60 a week to help with personal support if you’re both:</p>
<li>physically or mentally disabled</li>
<li>State Pension age or older</li>
<p>It does not cover mobility needs.</p>
<p>The other benefits you get can increase if you get Attendance Allowance.</p>
<p>You do not have to have someone caring for you in order to claim.</p>
<p>If you do have a carer, they could get Carer’s Allowance if you have substantial caring needs.</p>
<h1>What you'll get</h1>
<p>Attendance Allowance is paid weekly at 2 different rates - the one you get depends on the level of help you need.</p>
<p>Attendance Allowance is not means-tested - what you earn or how much you have in savings will not affect what you get.</p>
<h2>Attendance Allowance rates</h2>
<tr>Rate | Level of help you need</tr>
<tr>Lower rate - £60 | Frequent help or constant supervision during the day, or supervision at night</tr>
<tr>Higher rate - £89.60 | Help or supervision throughout both day and night, or you’re terminally ill</tr>
<p>If your circumstances change, you could get a different rate. You must report a change of circumstances.</p>
<p>You could get extra Pension Credit, Housing Benefit or Council Tax Reduction if you get Attendance Allowance - check with the helpline or office dealing with your benefit.</p>
<h2>How you’re paid</h2>
<p>All benefits are paid into your bank, building society or credit union account.</p>
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>You can get Attendance Allowance if you’ve reached State Pension age and the following apply:</p>
<li>you have a physical disability (including sensory disability, for example blindness), a mental disability (including learning difficulties), or both</li>
<li>your disability is severe enough for you to need help caring for yourself or someone to supervise you, for your own or someone else’s safety</li>
<li>you have needed that help for at least 6 months (unless you’re terminally ill)</li>
<p>You must also:</p>
<li>be in Great Britain when you claim - there are some exceptions, such as members and family members of the armed forces</li>
<li>have been in Great Britain for at least 2 of the last 3 years (this does not apply if you’re a refugee or have humanitarian protection status)</li>
<li>be habitually resident in the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man or the Channel Islands</li>
<li>not be subject to immigration control (unless you’re a sponsored immigrant)</li>
<h2>If you live in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein</h2>
<p>You might still be able to get Attendance Allowance if you’re a UK national and you live in or move to the EU, European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.</p>
<p>Read guidance to find out if you can get benefits in the EU, EEA or Switzerland.</p>
<h2>If you’re terminally ill</h2>
<p>If you’re not expected to live for more than 6 months, there are ‘special rules’:</p>
<li>there’s no qualifying period for how long you’ve had your illness</li>
<li>if you’re eligible, you’ll automatically get the higher rate of Attendance Allowance</li>
<h2>If you’re in a care home</h2>
<p>You cannot usually get Attendance Allowance if you live in a care home and your care is paid for by your local authority. You can still claim Attendance Allowance if you pay for all your care home costs yourself.</p>
<h2>If you need an assessment</h2>
<p>You’ll only need to attend an assessment to check your eligibility if it’s unclear how your illness or disability affects you.</p>
<p>If you do need an assessment you’ll get a letter saying why and where you must go. During the assessment, a healthcare professional will need to examine you.</p>
<p>You cannot get Attendance Allowance if you already get Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Personal Independence Payment (PIP).</p>
<h1>How to claim</h1>
<p>Use the Attendance Allowance claim form to apply by post. The form comes with notes telling you how to fill it in.</p>
<p>Send the completed form to:</p>
<p>You do not need a postcode or a stamp.</p>
<p>Call the Attendance Allowance helpline to ask for:</p>
<li>a copy of the form</li>
<li>alternative formats, such as braille, large print or audio CD</li>
<h2>Backdating your claim</h2>
<p>Attendance Allowance can be backdated to the date of your claim. This is usually the date your form is received or the date you call the enquiry line (if you then return the claim pack within 6 weeks).</p>
<h2>If you’re terminally ill (‘special rules’)</h2>
<p>There are ‘special rules’ so you get Attendance Allowance more quickly if you’re not expected to live more than 6 months. You must:</p>
<li>complete an Attendance Allowance form</li>
<li>ask a doctor or other healthcare professional for form DS1500 - they’ll either fill it in and give the form to you or send it directly to DWP</li>
<p>You can do this on behalf of someone else without their permission. The letter about the money awarded will not mention ‘special rules’.</p>
<h2>If you disagree with a decision</h2>
<p>You can challenge a decision about your claim. This is called asking for mandatory reconsideration.</p>
<h2>Complaints</h2>
<p>You can complain to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if you’re unhappy with the service you’ve received.</p>
