Find an immigration adviser
<h1>Search for an adviser</h1>
<p>You can get immigration advice from an immigration adviser if you need help with getting permission to stay in the UK.</p>
<p>Immigration advisers can help you with most things to do with immigration, including helping you to fill in the right forms and representing you at a tribunal. They do not make immigration decisions.</p>
<p>Check if the adviser is registered and if they charge a fee before you use them.</p>
<p>If you’re an EU citizen and you were living in the UK by 31 December 2020, you can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living here after 30 June 2021. If you want to move to the UK from 1 January 2021, you may need to apply for a visa.</p>
<h2>Find a registered immigration adviser</h2>
<p>Use the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC) Adviser Finder to find a registered adviser near you.</p>
<p>All immigration advisers must be registered with OISC or be a member of an approved professional body, for example The Law Society.</p>
<h3>If you want legal help</h3>
<p>You can find solicitors who give immigration advice through:</p>
<li>The Law Society if you live in England or Wales</li>
<li>The Law Society of Scotland</li>
<li>The Law Society of Northern Ireland</li>
<h2>Regulating immigration advisers</h2>
<p>OISC regulates immigration advisers and makes sure they meet certain standards. For example, advisers must:</p>
<li>carry insurance against giving poor advice</li>
<li>keep up to date with current immigration advice</li>
<p>OISC maintains a register of the immigration advisers that they regulate.</p>
<h2>Make a complaint</h2>
<p>You can complain about an immigration adviser if you think you’ve had a bad service.</p>
<p>You cannot get your money back if an adviser is not regulated.</p>
<h2>Suspended immigration advisers</h2>
<p>You can see a list of people who are banned from acting as immigration advisers.</p>
<h1>What advisers can do</h1>
<p>Immigration advisers are only allowed to give you advice on things they’re qualified to help you with.</p>
<p>You can see what advice they can give you by their ‘level’. There are 3 levels.</p>
<p>Check an immigration adviser is allowed to give you the advice you need before you use them.</p>
<p>Only a level 3 adviser can appear on your behalf at an immigration tribunal.</p>
<h2>Level 1 - advice and assistance</h2>
<p>A level 1 adviser can give you advice on simple cases, for example getting a business visa extension when you have no problems with work and all necessary documents.</p>
<p>Level 1 advisers can advise you on:</p>
<li>entry clearance</li>
<li>leave to enter</li>
<li>leave to remain</li>
<li>nationality and citizenship</li>
<li>EU and EEA law</li>
<p>The detailed guide explains what level 1 advisers can do.</p>
<h2>Level 2 - casework</h2>
<p>Level 2 advisers can do everything that Level 1 advisers can do, but can also accept more complicated cases.</p>
<p>You may want to use a level 2 adviser if you’ve had problems in the past with immigration and want permission to remain in the UK.</p>
<p>Advisers in this category can also help:</p>
<li>with claims for asylum and human rights applications</li>
<li>get your visa application decision reviewed (an ‘administrative review’)</li>
<li>if you entered the UK illegally or stayed after your visa expired</li>
<li>if you’re being removed or deported</li>
<p>The detailed guide explains what level 2 advisers can do.</p>
<h2>Level 3 - advocacy and representation</h2>
<p>Level 3 advisers can do everything that Level 1 and 2 advisers can.</p>
<p>They can also appear on your behalf at an immigration tribunal. In certain situations they can help you if you go to court.</p>
<p>The detailed guide explains what level 3 advisers can do.</p>
<h1>Hiring an adviser</h1>
<p>When you hire an immigration adviser:</p>
<li>find out how much they charge and if you’ll have to pay them</li>

<li>ask how much you’ll have to pay if you decide you do not want to use them any more</li>
<li>agree a fee before they do any extra work for you</li>
<p>Some advisers do not charge a fee. If they do not charge, you’ll still have to pay for any expenses like translation costs and application fees.</p>
