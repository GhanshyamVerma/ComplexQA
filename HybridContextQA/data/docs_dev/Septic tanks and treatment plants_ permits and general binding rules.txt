Septic tanks and treatment plants: permits and general binding rules
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>If your house or business is not connected to the mains sewer, your sewage will go to one of the following:</p>
<li>a septic tank - an underground tank where the solids sink to the bottom and the liquid flows out and soaks through the ground</li>
<li>a small sewage treatment plant (also known as a package treatment plant) - a part-mechanical system that treats the liquid so it’s clean enough to go into a river or stream</li>
<li>a cesspool (also called a cesspit) - a sealed tank that collects the sewage</li>
<li>a non-standard system, such as a reed bed or trench arch system</li>
<p>There are different rules for septic tanks and treatment plants in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p>
<h2>You have a non-standard system</h2>
<p>You must contact the Environment Agency to find out if you need a permit.</p>
<h1>You have a septic tank or small sewage treatment plant</h1>
<p>As the ‘operator’ of a septic tank or small sewage treatment plant you must check you meet the general binding rules. You must apply for a permit if you do not.</p>
<p>You’re an operator if any of the following is true:</p>
<li>you own the property that uses the system</li>
<li>you own a property that shares the system with other properties - each property owner is an operator, and you’re jointly responsible for complying with the general binding rules</li>
<li>you have a written agreement with the property owner that says you’re responsible for the system’s maintenance, for example you’re renting and it’s in your tenancy agreement</li>
<p>Contact the Environment Agency if you’re not sure whether you’re an operator.</p>
<h1>The general binding rules</h1>
<p>You must follow the general binding rules if you’re the operator of a septic tank or small sewage treatment plant.</p>
<p>The sewage must:</p>
<li>be domestic in nature, for example from a toilet, bathroom, shower or kitchen of a house, flat or business (such as a pub, hotel or office) - contact the Environment Agency if you’re not sure if the sewage is domestic in nature</li>
<li>not cause pollution - find out how to check for pollution</li>
<p>There are other rules depending on whether you’re releasing this sewage:</p>
<li>to the ground, for example in your back garden</li>
<li>to a surface water, for example a river or stream</li>
<p>Ask your local installation or maintenance company if you’re not sure what sort of system you have.</p>
<h2>Releasing to the ground</h2>
<p>You must use a septic tank or a small sewage treatment plant and a drainage field (infiltration system).</p>
<p>You must apply for a permit if you release (‘discharge’):</p>
<li>to a well, borehole or other deep structure</li>
<li>more than 2 cubic metres (2,000 litres) per day</li>
<li>in a groundwater source protection zone (SPZ1)</li>
<p>You must also read the additional rules for discharging sewage to the ground.</p>
<h3>Calculate how much sewage you discharge</h3>
<p>For sewage from a residential property, use the calculator to work out how much you discharge per day.</p>
<p>For commercial properties (such as a hotel, restaurant or office) or holiday accommodation (such as a cottage or chalet), use British Water’s flows and loads guidance or contact the Environment Agency for advice.</p>
<h3>Work out if you’re in a groundwater source protection zone 1 (SPZ1)</h3>
<p>An SPZ1 can be either:</p>
<li>the area around a commercial water supply shown on the map of protected zones - check whether your discharge is in the inner zone (Zone 1) or ask the Environment Agency</li>
<li>any area within 50 metres of a private water supply for human consumption - ask your neighbours if they have a spring, well or borehole, and how far it is from your drainage field</li>
<h2>Releasing to a surface water</h2>
<p>You must use a small sewage treatment plant. You must apply for a permit if you’re discharging more than 5 cubic metres (5,000 litres) per day. Use the calculator to work out how much you discharge per day.</p>
<p>You must also read the additional rules for discharging sewage to a surface water.</p>
<p>For commercial properties (such as a hotel, restaurant or office) or holiday accommodation (such as a cottage or chalet), use British Water’s flows and loads guidance or contact the Environment Agency for advice.</p>
<h2>Installing a new system</h2>
<p>You must have building regulations approval. You may also need planning permission.</p>
<p>Check with your local council.</p>
<h3>If you did not get permission and approval</h3>
<p>You must apply retrospectively for building regulations approval. You may also need planning permission.</p>
<p>If your system was installed before 1 January 2015, you should contact your local council for advice.</p>
<h1>Apply for a permit</h1>
<p>You’ll need a permit if you do not meet the general binding rules.</p>
<p>The form you need to fill in depends on:</p>
<li>where you discharge the sewage</li>
<li>how much you discharge</li>
<h2>If you discharge sewage to ground</h2>
<p>There are different forms depending on whether you’re in a groundwater protection zone (SPZ1).</p>
<h3>Outside an SPZ1</h3>
<p>There are different forms if you discharge:</p>
<li>between 2 and 15 cubic metres per day</li>
<li>over 15 cubic metres per day</li>
<h3>Inside an SPZ1</h3>
<p>If you discharge less than 2 cubic metres per day there are different forms:</p>
<li>for systems in use before 1 January 2015</li>
<li>for those installed on or after 1 January 2015</li>
<p>There are different forms if you discharge:</p>
<li>between 2 and 15 cubic metres per day</li>
<li>over 15 cubic metres per day</li>
<h2>If you discharge sewage to a surface water</h2>
<p>If you discharge between 5 and 20 cubic metres per day, check if you can apply for a standard rules permit.</p>
<p>If you cannot get a standard rules permit, you’ll need a permit to discharge:</p>
<li>up to 20 cubic metres</li>
<li>over 20 cubic metres</li>
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<p>You need:</p>
<li>the 8-figure grid reference for your septic tank or treatment plant and the point where it discharges</li>
<li>to calculate the largest amount you’re likely to discharge - use one of the calculators in the chapter on the general binding rules</li>
<li>to provide a suitable site plan – see an example site plan</li>
