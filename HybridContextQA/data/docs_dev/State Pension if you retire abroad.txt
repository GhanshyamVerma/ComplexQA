State Pension if you retire abroad
<h1>Claim State Pension abroad</h1>
<p>You can claim State Pension abroad if you’ve paid enough UK National Insurance  contributions to qualify.</p>

<h2>Make a claim</h2>
<p>You must be within 4 months of your State Pension age to claim.</p>
<p>To claim your pension, you can either:</p>
<li>contact the International Pension Centre</li>
<li>send the international claim form to the International Pension Centre (the address is on the form)</li>
<h2>If you live part of the year abroad</h2>
<p>You must choose which country you want your pension to be paid in. You cannot be paid in one country for part of the year and another for the rest of the year.</p>
<h2>Bank accounts your pension can be paid into</h2>
<p>Your State Pension can be paid into:</p>
<li>a bank in the country you’re living in</li>
<li>a bank or building society in the UK</li>
<p>You can use:</p>
<li>an account in your name</li>
<li>a joint account</li>
<li>someone else’s account - if you have their permission and keep to the terms and conditions of the account</li>
<p>You’ll need the international bank account number (IBAN) and bank identification code (BIC) numbers if you have an overseas account.</p>
<p>You’ll be paid in local currency - the amount you get may change due to exchange rates.</p>
<h2>When you’ll get paid</h2>
<p>You can choose to be paid every 4 or 13 weeks.</p>
<p>If your State Pension is under £5 per week, you’ll be paid once a year in December.</p>
<h3>Delays to payments around US bank holidays</h3>
<p>If you live abroad and your payment is due in the same week as a US bank holiday, it could arrive one day late. This is because a US company processes these payments.</p>
<h1>How your pension is affected</h1>
<p>Your State Pension will only increase each year if you live in:</p>
<li>the European Economic Area (EEA)</li>
<li>Gibraltar</li>
<li>Switzerland</li>
<li>countries that have a social security agreement with the UK (but you cannot get increases in Canada or New Zealand)</li>
<p>You will not get yearly increases if you live outside these countries.</p>
<p>Your pension will go up to the current rate if you return to live in the UK.</p>
<h2>Get advice</h2>
<p>Contact the International Pension Centre if you want advice on how your pension might be affected if you’ve already retired and are thinking of moving abroad.</p>
<h1>Paying tax</h1>
<p>How much tax you’ll pay and where you pay it depends on where you’re considered to be a resident.</p>
<h2>UK residents</h2>
<p>You may have to pay UK tax on your State Pension if you live abroad but are classed as a UK resident for tax purposes. The amount you pay depends on your income.</p>
<h2>Overseas residents</h2>
<p>You may be taxed on your State Pension by the UK and the country where you live. 
If you pay tax twice, you can usually claim tax relief to get all or some of it back.</p>
<p>If the country you live in has a ‘double taxation agreement’ with the UK, you’ll only pay tax on your pension once. This may be to the UK or the country where you live, depending on that country’s tax agreement.</p>
<h1>Report a change in your circumstances</h1>
<p>Report changes (such as a change of address or bank details) to the International Pension Centre by phone or in writing - do not send changes by email.</p>
<h2>If you’re asked to fill in a ‘life certificate’</h2>
<p>You may get a ‘life certificate’ form from the Department for Work and Pensions to check you’re still eligible for the State Pension.</p>
<p>You need to get the form signed by a witness. The instructions are on the form.</p>
<p>Your witness does not have to live in the UK or have a passport from any specific country.</p>
<p>The people who can sign the form are the same as those who can ‘countersign’ a passport photo.</p>
<p>Your payments may be suspended if you do not send the form back.</p>
<h2>Returning to the UK</h2>
<p>Contact the Pension Service - you need your return date and contact details, both abroad and in the UK.</p>
<p>Call HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to say you’re returning to the UK.</p>
