Master's Loan
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>A Postgraduate Master’s Loan can help with course fees and living costs while you study a postgraduate master’s course.</p>
<p>Funding for postgraduate loans is different if:</p>
<li>you normally live in Scotland</li>
<li>you normally live in Wales</li>
<li>you normally live in Northern Ireland.</li>
<p>Moving somewhere to study does not count as normally living there.</p>
<p>You can also get extra support if you have a disability.</p>
<p>You will not be eligible for an Adult Dependants’ Grant, a Childcare Grant or Parents’ Learning Allowance from Student Finance England if you’re studying a master’s course.</p>
<h2>When you can apply</h2>
<p>You’ll be able to apply for funding for the 2021 to 2022 academic year from summer 2021. Applications are not yet open - this guide will be updated as soon as they are.</p>
<h2>When you repay your loan</h2>
<p>You’ll have to start repaying your loan when your income is over a certain amount (the ‘threshold’ amount).</p>
<p>You’ll be charged interest from the day you get the first payment.</p>
<h1>What you'll get</h1>
<p>You can get up to:</p>
<li>£11,570 if your course starts on or after 1 August 2021</li>
<li>£11,222 if your course started between 1 August 2020 and 31 July 2021</li>
<li>£10,906 if your course started between 1 August 2019 and 31 July 2020</li>
<p>The amount you’ll get is not based on your income or your family’s.</p>
<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) may take account of the loan when working out any benefits you receive.</p>
<p>The loan is paid directly to you. You can use it for your course fees and living costs.</p>
<p>If your course lasts for more than a year, the loan will be divided equally across each year of your course.</p>
<h2>When you’re paid</h2>
<p>You get the first payment after your course start date, once your university or college confirms that you’ve registered.</p>
<p>The loan will be paid in 3 instalments of 33%, 33% and 34% each year. After your application has been approved, you’ll be sent a letter with your payment dates. You can also check them in your online account.</p>
<h3>If you change university or college</h3>
<p>Your new university or college has to confirm the change with Student Finance England before you receive any more payments.</p>
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>Whether you qualify depends on:</p>
<li>your course</li>
<li>your age</li>
<li>your nationality or residency status</li>
<p>You will not be able to get a Postgraduate Master’s Loan if:</p>
<li>you’re already getting payments from Student Finance England for another course that you’re studying</li>
<li>you’ve received a loan or grant for a master’s course before - unless you got a Disabled Students’ Allowance or you left your course for a serious personal reason like illness or bereavement</li>
<li>you already have a master’s degree, or a qualification that’s equivalent or higher</li>
<li>you’re behind in repayments for any previous loans from the Student Loans Company</li>
<p>You’ll still be eligible if you have a PGCE or a postgraduate diploma or certificate.</p>
<p>You will not get extra money if you repeat a year of your course.</p>
<h2>Your course</h2>
<p>It must:</p>
<li>be a full, standalone master’s course (not a top-up course)</li>
<li>be worth at least 180 credits - check the course provider’s website if you’re not sure</li>
<li>have started on or after 1 August 2016</li>
<p>Your course must be provided by an eligible university or college in the UK (including the Open University). Check with the university or college that your course is registered.</p>
<p>Your course can be taught or research-based.</p>
<p>It can be:</p>
<li>full-time, lasting 1 or 2 academic years</li>
<li>part-time, lasting 2 to 4 academic years - no more than twice the length of the equivalent full-time course</li>
<li>part-time for up to 3 years, where no equivalent full-time course exists</li>
<p>Examples of postgraduate master’s qualifications include:</p>
<li>MSc (master of science)</li>

<p>You cannot get a Postgraduate Master’s Loan for a postgraduate certificate or diploma.</p>
<h3>Distance learning</h3>
<p>To qualify for a Postgraduate Master’s Loan for distance learning, you’ll need to be living in England on the first day of the first academic year of your course. You’ll also need to live in:</p>
<li>England for the whole of your course, if you’re an EU national</li>

<li>integrated with an undergraduate degree - apply for undergraduate funding instead</li>
<li>integrated with a doctoral degree - apply for a Postgraduate Doctoral Loan instead</li>
<h3>Intercalated year</h3>
<p>You might be eligible for a Postgraduate Master’s Loan if you’re taking a year out of an undergraduate course to study for a master’s.</p>
<p>This will generally mean you’re not entitled to undergraduate funding anymore because you’ll hold a higher level qualification.</p>

<li>architecture</li>
<li>dentistry</li>
<li>medicine</li>
<li>social work</li>
<li>undergraduate Initial Teacher Training</li>
<li>veterinary science</li>
<h3>Master of architecture</h3>
<p>If you plan to study for a master of architecture (MArch Part 2) qualification full-time, apply for undergraduate funding support. Your course must be accredited by the Architects Registration Board (ARB) to be eligible.</p>
<p>You can only apply for the Postgraduate Master’s Loan to support your MArch course if one of the following applies:</p>
<li>you’re taking a part-time course</li>
<li>you’re not eligible for undergraduate funding support</li>
<li>the course does not lead to an accredited qualification as an architect</li>
<h3>Healthcare and social work</h3>
<p>You cannot get a Postgraduate Master’s Loan if you:</p>

<li>get a Social Work Bursary - unless you only get a Placement Travel Allowance</li>
<p>This also applies for health and social work bursaries in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
