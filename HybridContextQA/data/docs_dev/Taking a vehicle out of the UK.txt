Taking a vehicle out of the UK
<h1>For 12 months or more</h1>
<p>You must tell DVLA if you’re taking your vehicle out of the UK, including to the Channel Islands (Jersey and Guernsey), Isle of Man or Ireland, for 12 months or more.</p>
<p>This is known as permanent export. You’ll need to:</p>
<li>Fill in the ‘permanent export’ section of your vehicle log book (V5C) and detach it from the log book.</li>
<li>Send the completed ‘permanent export’ section to DVLA, Swansea, SA99 1BD. Include a letter if you’ve moved abroad and want your vehicle tax refund (if you’re entitled to one) sent to your new address.</li>
<li>Keep the rest of your log book (V5C) - you need it to register your vehicle in the country you’re taking it to.</li>
<li>Update the address on your driving licence if you’re moving home.</li>
<p>If you’re due a refund, it will take longer than usual because of coronavirus (COVID-19). The refund is worked out from the date DVLA gets your ‘permanent export’ section.</p>
<p>If you’re buying a vehicle to take abroad make sure the seller follows the correct process for vehicles that will be registered in another country. They must give you the full log book (V5C) - not just the new keeper slip.</p>
<h2>If you do not have a vehicle log book (V5C)</h2>
<h3>Before you leave the UK</h3>
<p>You need to get a vehicle log book (V5C) before you leave the UK. DVLA cannot send a vehicle log book to an address outside the UK.</p>
<p>When you get your log book, fill in and send the ‘permanent export’ section to DVLA.</p>
<p>It will take longer than usual to get your V5C log book because of coronavirus. If you do not receive it before you leave the UK, contact the driving authority of the country you’re travelling to to find out what documents you need.</p>
<h3>If you’ve already left the UK</h3>
<p>Contact the driving authority of the country you’re taking the vehicle to. They’ll tell you what documents you’ll need to provide to register the vehicle there.</p>
<p>You also need to send a letter to DVLA to tell them you’ve taken the vehicle out of the country. Include:</p>
<li>your name and address</li>
<li>the date you took the vehicle out of the country</li>
<li>where DVLA can send the vehicle tax refund (if you’re entitled to one)</li>
<h3>If you cannot get a vehicle log book (V5C)</h3>
<p>Contact the driving authority of the country you’re taking the vehicle to - they’ll tell you how to register your vehicle.</p>
<p>Send a letter to DVLA to tell them you’ve taken the vehicle out of the country. Include:</p>
<li>your name and address</li>
<li>the date you took the vehicle out of the country</li>
<li>where DVLA can send the vehicle tax refund</li>
<h2>If the ‘permanent export’ section is missing</h2>
<p>If the ‘permanent export’ section is not in the log book, send a letter to DVLA to tell them you’ve taken the vehicle out of the country. Include:</p>
<li>your name and address</li>
<li>the date you took the vehicle out of the country</li>
<h2>Moving your vehicle between Great Britain and Northern Ireland</h2>
<p>Fill in the change of address section in your log book and send it to DVLA.</p>
<h2>Personalised registrations</h2>
<p>You’ll need to transfer or retain your personalised registration before exporting your vehicle. Otherwise you’ll lose your right to the registration number.</p>
<h1>For less than 12 months</h1>
<p>You must take your vehicle log book (V5C) with you if you’re taking your vehicle abroad for less than 12 months. You may have to show it if you’re stopped at a port or while driving abroad.</p>
<p>Your V5C must show your most recent address in the UK.</p>
<p>Apply in advance if you need to get a V5C or update your V5C before you travel. It will take longer than usual to get your new V5C because of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
<p>UK law still applies to a UK-registered vehicle if you take it abroad for less than 12 months. That means you need to make sure:</p>
<li>your vehicle is taxed in the UK while it’s abroad</li>
<li>you have a current MOT</li>
<li>you have insurance</li>
<p>You’ll also need to make sure you meet any international or national conditions for licensing and taxation.</p>
<h2>Check if you need to pay import duty</h2>
<p>You may need to pay import duty on your vehicle if you take it outside the UK.  Check with the authorities in the country you’re taking your vehicle to.</p>
<p>You do not need to pay import duty to take your vehicle from Northern Ireland to Great Britain or the EU.</p>
<p>If you’re going to a non-EU country that charges duty, you can buy a CPD Carnet. This lets you take your vehicle into the country temporarily without paying duty. It can also make crossing the border simpler.</p>
<p>You’ll have to pay a fee and a deposit. You usually get the carnet within 4 weeks of applying.</p>
<h2>Taking a vehicle to Liechtenstein, Mexico or Somalia</h2>
<p>You must take an International Certificate for Motor Vehicles (ICMV) with you as well as your V5C.</p>
<p>Apply for an ICMV.</p>
<h2>Bringing your vehicle back untaxed</h2>
<p>If you bring your vehicle back to the UK untaxed you cannot drive it back into the UK - it’ll have to be transported and a SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification) must be made straight away.</p>
<h2>Taking hired or leased vehicles abroad temporarily</h2>
<p>You’ll need a VE103 vehicle on hire certificate to show you’re allowed to use a hired or leased vehicle if you’re driving it abroad.</p>
<p>You can get a VE103 for a fee from the:</p>
<li>British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA)</li>
<li>Logistics UK</li>
<li>RAC Motoring Services</li>
<li>Road Haulage Association (RHA)</li>
<h1>Taxes if you buy a new vehicle to take abroad</h1>
<p>If you buy a new or used vehicle to take out of the UK, you might not have to pay UK VAT or vehicle taxes such as the registration fee.</p>
<p>What you pay and how you pay it depends on where you’re exporting to and from.</p>
<h2>Export your vehicle with the Personal Export Scheme</h2>
<p>You may be able to use the Personal Export Scheme to take a new or used vehicle:</p>
<li>from Great Britain to anywhere outside the UK</li>
<li>from Northern Ireland to a non-EU country</li>
<p>When you buy a new vehicle and export under the scheme, you do not pay UK VAT. But you still have to pay vehicle taxes and the registration fee.</p>
<p>You must be planning to leave the UK for at least 6 months with the vehicle. You usually have to be personally driving your vehicle.</p>
<h3>What you need to do</h3>
<p>Fill in form VAT 410 (your supplier will give you a copy) and give it to your supplier.</p>
<p>You can drive the vehicle in the UK for up to 6 months after the delivery date (or 12 months for non-UK and non-EU residents) - it must then be exported.</p>
<p>The date for export of the vehicle is shown on the VX302 (for new cars) or the VAT 410 (for used cars).</p>
<p>After export send the DVLA the:</p>
<li>VX302 - new vehicles</li>
<li>V5C - second-hand vehicles</li>
<p>If you do not export the vehicle on time you’ll have to pay the UK VAT.</p>
<h2>Export your vehicle from Northern Ireland to the EU</h2>
<p>If you buy a new vehicle in Northern Ireland to take to an EU country, you do not have to pay UK VAT if you:</p>
<li>take the vehicle out of the UK within 2 months</li>
<li>do not drive the vehicle in the UK unless you register and tax it</li>
<p>Your supplier will get you to fill in form VAT 411.</p>
<p>You’ll have to declare your vehicle and pay VAT in the other country when you get there.</p>
