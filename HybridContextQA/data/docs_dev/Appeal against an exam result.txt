Appeal against an exam result
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>You can challenge the results of an exam or qualification if you think it’s wrong.</p>
<h2>GCSEs, AS levels or A levels</h2>
<p>You can ask your school or college to get an exam result looked at again - this is called requesting a review.</p>
<p>If you’re not satisfied with the outcome, your school or college can make an appeal to Ofqual.</p>
<h2>Other qualifications</h2>
<p>Ask your school or college to appeal to the awarding organisation about the results for any other qualification, for example a BTEC or an NVQ.</p>
<p>You can appeal directly to the awarding organisation if you’re a private student, for example, if you are home schooled or are a mature student.</p>
<p>The awarding organisation will send you a final report after they’ve reviewed the result.</p>
<p>If you’re not happy with the outcome of the appeal, you can contact Ofqual to make a complaint.</p>

<h2>Who can request a GCSE, AS level or A level review</h2>
<p>You can ask your school or college to get an exam result looked at again (known as ‘requesting a review’). You cannot request a review yourself unless you’re a private candidate, for example you were home schooled.</p>
<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>You can appeal against a review if you’re unhappy with the decision.</p>
<p>You or your school may have to pay if the mark is not changed.</p>
