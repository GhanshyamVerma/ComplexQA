Get help with funeral costs (Funeral Expenses Payment)
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>You could get a Funeral Expenses Payment (also called a Funeral Payment) if you get certain benefits and need help to pay for a funeral you’re arranging.</p>
<p>This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).</p>
<h3>If you live in Scotland</h3>
<p>You can apply for a Funeral Support Payment. It has replaced Funeral Expenses Payment in Scotland.</p>
<h2>If you receive money from the deceased’s estate</h2>
<p>Your Funeral Expenses Payment will be deducted from any money you get from the deceased’s estate.</p>
<p>The estate includes any money or property they had but not a house or personal things left to a widow, widower or surviving civil partner.</p>
<h2>What you’ll get</h2>
<p>Funeral Expenses Payment can help pay for some of the costs of the following:</p>
<li>burial fees for a particular plot</li>
<li>cremation fees, including the cost of the doctor’s certificate</li>
<li>travel to arrange or go to the funeral</li>
<li>the cost of moving the body within the UK, if it’s being moved more than 50 miles</li>
<li>death certificates or other documents</li>
<p>You can also get up to £1,000 for any other funeral expenses, such as funeral director’s fees, flowers or the coffin.</p>
<p>The payment will not usually cover all of the costs of the funeral.</p>
<p>How much you get depends on your circumstances. This includes any other money that’s available to cover the costs, for example from an insurance policy or the deceased person’s estate.</p>
<p>Check the claim form notes for full details of what Funeral Expenses Payment covers.</p>
<p>If the deceased had a pre-paid funeral plan, you can only get up to £120 to help pay for items not covered by their plan.</p>
<h2>How the money is paid</h2>
<p>Funeral Expenses Payment is paid into your bank, building society or credit union account if you’ve already paid for the funeral.</p>
<p>The money will be paid directly to the organiser of the funeral (for example, the funeral director) if you have not paid yet.</p>
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>You can get a Funeral Expenses Payment if all of the following apply:</p>
<li>you get certain benefits or tax credits</li>
<li>you meet the rules on your relationship with the deceased</li>
<li>you’re arranging a funeral in the UK, the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland</li>
<p>You might be able to get other help to pay for the funeral if you’re not eligible for Funeral Expenses Payment.</p>
<h2>Benefits and tax credits you must get</h2>
<p>You (or your partner) must get one or more of the following:</p>
<li>Income Support</li>
<li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
<li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
<li>Pension Credit</li>
<li>Housing Benefit</li>
<li>the disability or severe disability element of Working Tax Credit</li>
<li>Child Tax Credit</li>
<li>Universal Credit</li>
<p>You might also be eligible if you’re getting a Support for Mortgage Interest loan.</p>
<p>You can still claim Funeral Expenses Payment if you’ve applied for these benefits and you’re waiting to hear about your claim.</p>
<p>If you were responsible for a deceased child but you’re not their parent, the non-resident parent must get one or more of these benefits.</p>
<p>If there’s a close relative of the deceased who is not getting one of these benefits, you might not be able to claim Funeral Expenses Payment.</p>
<h2>Rules on your relationship with the deceased</h2>
<p>You must be one of the following:</p>
<li>the partner of the deceased when they died</li>
<li>a close relative or close friend of the deceased</li>
<li>the parent of a baby stillborn after 24 weeks of pregnancy</li>
<li>the parent or person responsible for a deceased child who was under 16 (or under 20 and in approved education or training)</li>
<p>You might not get a Funeral Expenses Payment if another close relative of the deceased (such as a sibling or parent) is in work.</p>
<h2>If the funeral will take place in the EEA or Switzerland</h2>
<p>Contact the Social Fund to check if you’re eligible.</p>
<h1>Make a claim</h1>
<p>You must apply within 6 months of the funeral, even if you’re waiting for a decision on a qualifying benefit.</p>
<p>You can make a claim before the funeral if you’ve got an invoice or signed contract from the funeral director. It cannot be an estimate.</p>
<p>If you get Universal Credit, you will not get a decision on your claim until after your next payment.</p>
<p>There’s a different way to claim if you live in Northern Ireland.</p>
<h2>How to claim</h2>
<p>Claim by phone by calling the Bereavement Service helpline.</p>
<p>An adviser will also help you claim any other bereavement benefits you might be entitled to.</p>
<p>You can also claim by post. Download and fill in the claim form (SF200), then send it to the address on the form.</p>
<h2>Appeal a Funeral Expenses Payment decision</h2>
<p>You can appeal to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal if you disagree with a decision about Funeral Expenses Payment.</p>
