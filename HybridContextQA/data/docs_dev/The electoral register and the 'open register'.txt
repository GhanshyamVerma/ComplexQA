The electoral register and the 'open register'
<h1>Get on the electoral register</h1>
<p>The electoral register (sometimes called the ‘electoral roll’) lists the names and addresses of everyone who’s registered to vote.</p>
<p>Use the register to vote service to:</p>
<li>get on the electoral register</li>
<li>update your details (for example change your name or address)</li>
<p>To check whether you’re already on the register, contact:</p>
<li>your local Electoral Registration Office if you live in England, Scotland or Wales</li>
<li>the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI) if you live in Northern Ireland</li>
<h2>What happens if you do not register</h2>
<p>You must register to vote if you’re asked to do so and you meet the conditions for registering, for example you’re 16 or over and you’re British or a national of an EU or Commonwealth country.</p>
<p>If you’re asked to register and do not, you could be fined.</p>
<p>You will not be fined if you have a valid reason for not registering, for example a long stay in hospital, or you have severe learning difficulties.</p>
<h2>When you can register in more than one place</h2>
<p>It’s sometimes possible to register at 2 addresses (though you can only vote once in any election).</p>
<p>For example, if you’re a student with different home and term-time addresses, you may be able to register at both.</p>
<p>Register to vote twice if you live at 2 addresses.</p>
<h2>The annual canvass</h2>
<p>From July each year Electoral Registration Offices (EROs) contact households to check if the details on the electoral register are correct. This is called the annual canvass.</p>
<p>You will be contacted by post, email, phone or by someone knocking on your door.</p>
<h2>Canvass 2021 in Northern Ireland</h2>
<p>From 1 July 2021, the electoral register in Northern Ireland will be renewed as part of the national canvass. If you want to vote in future elections, you must register to vote after 1 July, even if you’ve registered before.</p>
<h1>Opt out of the 'open register'</h1>
<p>There are 2 versions of the electoral register - the full version and the ‘open register’ (known as the ‘edited register’ in Northern Ireland).</p>
<p>If you registered to vote anonymously your details will not appear on either version of the electoral register. You will still be able to vote.</p>
<h2>How to opt out of the open register</h2>
<p>You can opt out of the open register. This is the version of the register that’s available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.</p>
<p>To opt out, either:</p>
<li>use the register to vote service (even if you’re already registered)</li>
<li>contact your local Electoral Registration Office if you live in England, Scotland or Wales</li>
<li>contact the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI) if you live in Northern Ireland</li>
<p>Opting out does not affect your right to vote.</p>
<p>When you opt out of the open register, your details will still appear on the full version of the electoral register.</p>
<h2>The full version and what it can be used for</h2>
<p>Everyone’s name and address goes on the full version of the electoral register, and you cannot opt out. This is the version of the register that’s used for elections and referendums.</p>
<p>The full version of the register can only be used for:</p>
<li>electoral administration purposes (such as sending out poll cards before elections)</li>
<li>campaigning activities (for example, candidates and political parties sending election communications to voters, surveying opinions or fundraising)</li>
<li>preventing and detecting crime</li>
<li>checking applications for loans or credit</li>
<li>jury summoning in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</li>
