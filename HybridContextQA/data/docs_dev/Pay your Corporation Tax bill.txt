<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The deadline for your payment will depend on your taxable profits.</p>
<h3>Taxable profits of up to £1.5 million</h3>
<p>You must pay your Corporation Tax 9 months and 1 day after the end of your accounting period. Your accounting period is usually your financial year, but you may have 2 accounting periods in the year you set up your company.</p>

<p>You must pay your Corporation Tax in instalments.</p>
<p>Check the rules and deadlines:</p>
<li>if your taxable profits are between £1.5 million and £20 million</li>
<li>if your taxable profits are more than £20 million</li>

<h2>Multiple payments by CHAPS</h2>

<p>HMRC’s banking address is:</p>
<h1>Approve a payment through your online bank account</h1>
<p>You can pay your Corporation Tax bill directly using your online or mobile bank account.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to pay, select ‘start a payment’ and then ‘pay by bank account’. You’ll then be directed to sign in to your online or mobile banking account to approve your Corporation Tax payment.</p>
<p>The payment is usually instant but sometimes it takes up to 2 hours to show in your account.</p>
<p>You’ll need to have your online banking details ready to pay this way.</p>
<h1>By debit or corporate credit card online</h1>
<p>You can pay online.</p>
<p>There’s a fee if you pay by corporate credit card or corporate debit card. The fee is not refundable.</p>
<p>There’s no fee if you pay by personal debit card.</p>
<p>You cannot pay with a personal credit card.</p>
<p>Use your 17-character Corporation Tax payslip reference for the accounting period you’re paying.</p>
<p>You’ll find the payslip reference:</p>
<li>on any payslip that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) sent you</li>
<li>through your company’s HMRC online account - choose ‘View account’ then ‘Accounting period’</li>
<p>Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.</p>
<p>If you’re unable to pay your Corporation Tax bill in full by card, you should use another payment method like a bank transfer.</p>
<h2>How long it takes</h2>
<p>Allow 3 working days for your payment to reach HMRC’s bank account.</p>
<h1>At your bank or building society</h1>
<p>You can pay at a branch by cash or cheque.</p>
<p>You’ll need to use the payslip that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) sends you.</p>
<p>Make your cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’.</p>
<p>Write your 17-character Corporation Tax payslip reference number on the back of your cheque
for the accounting period you’re paying. You can find the reference number on the payslip sent to you by HMRC.</p>
<p>Allow 3 working days for your payment to reach HMRC’s bank account.</p>
<h2>If you do not have a payslip</h2>
<p>You’ll need to pay by another method instead, for example:</p>
<li>debit or credit card online</li>
<li>online or telephone banking</li>
<li>Direct Debit</li>
<h1>Direct Debit</h1>
<p>Set up and make changes to a Direct Debit through your company’s HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) online account.</p>
<p>Use your 17-character Corporation Tax payslip reference for the accounting period you’re paying.</p>
<p>You can find the payslip reference:</p>
<li>on the payslip that HMRC sent you</li>
<li>through your company’s HMRC online account - choose ‘View account’ then ‘Accounting period’</li>
<p>Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.</p>
<h2>How long it takes</h2>
<p>Allow 5 working days to process a Direct Debit the first time you set one up.</p>
<p>It should take 3 working days each time you pay once you’ve already authorised a Direct Debit from HMRC.</p>
<p>Payments will appear on your bank statements as ‘HMRC NDDS’.</p>
<h1>Payments for a group of companies</h1>
<p>If your company is in a group, you can pay Corporation Tax under a Group Payment Arrangement. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will write to tell you the correct payslip reference.</p>
<h1>Tell HMRC no payment is due</h1>
<p>Tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you have nothing to pay. HMRC will send you payment reminders if you do not.</p>
<p>You can tell HMRC by either:</p>
<li>filling in the ‘nil to pay’ form</li>
<li>sending back the payslip on the reminder HMRC sends you, marked ‘NIL due’</li>
<p>You must still file your company tax return.</p>
<h1>Check your payment has been received</h1>
<p>Check your HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) online account to see if your payment has been received. It should be updated within a few days of HMRC receiving the payment.</p>
