Driving instructor suspension: your rights
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Your approved driving instructor (ADI) registration can be suspended if the ADI registrar thinks you pose a significant threat to public safety.</p>
<p>The ADI registrar can suspend you if they’re considering:</p>
<li>taking you off the ADI register</li>
<li>removing your trainee driving instructor licence</li>
<li>refusing to extend your registration or trainee licence</li>
<p>You cannot get paid for giving driving lessons if you’re suspended.</p>
<h2>Claiming compensation</h2>
<p>You can claim compensation if you’ve been suspended but are not then taken off the register.</p>
<p>There are different rules for your ADI registration in Northern Ireland.</p>
<h1>When you can be suspended</h1>
<p>Your approved driving instructor (ADI) registration can be suspended if the ADI registrar thinks you pose a significant threat to public safety.</p>
<p>For example, if you:</p>
<li>have been convicted of a sexual or violent offence</li>
<li>are giving dangerous instruction that’s a major risk to the safety of your pupils and other road users</li>
<h2>Telling you if you’re suspended</h2>
<p>You’ll get a letter from the ADI registrar to tell you that your registration is suspended.</p>
<p>This will usually be at that same time that the registrar writes to tell you that they’re considering taking you off the register.</p>
<h2>Challenging your suspension</h2>
<p>You can use a judicial review to challenge the way in which the ADI registrar made the decision to suspend you.</p>
<p>The review only looks at whether the right procedures have been followed, rather than the decision itself. You can download the judicial review claim form and guidance notes.</p>
<p>You still have the right to appeal against the ADI registrar’s decision to remove you if you end up being taken off the register.</p>
<h1>Compensation if you stay on the register</h1>
<p>You can get compensation if your approved driving instructor (ADI) registration was suspended, but you were not taken off the ADI register.</p>
<p>This includes cases where:</p>
<li>you win an appeal against the decision to take you off the register</li>
<li>the registrar considers taking you off the register, but then ends the suspension and lets you stay on the register</li>
<li>the registrar has not made a decision about taking you off the register within 75 days</li>
<h2>What you can claim</h2>
<p>You can claim compensation for income and non-income losses as a result of being suspended.</p>
<p>You can also claim for the cost of preparing your compensation application.</p>
<h3>Income losses</h3>
<p>‘Income losses’ are what you’d have got from giving driving lessons during the time you were suspended.</p>
<h3>Non-income losses</h3>
<p>‘Non-income losses’ are other losses you:</p>
<li>can give a monetary value to</li>
<li>incurred (within reason) while you were suspended</li>
<p>Examples of non-income losses include:</p>
<li>any reasonable costs you needed to pay to prepare your compensation application</li>
<li>the interest on a loan you had to take out as a result of the suspension</li>
<li>the value of any damage that the suspension caused to your driving school business if you run one</li>
<h1>How to claim compensation</h1>
<p>Download the application form and send it, with evidence to support your claim, to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA).</p>
<h2>When to claim</h2>
<p>You must send your claim within 2 years of whichever of these dates is later:</p>
<li>the date your suspension ended</li>
<li>the date you were told you’d won your appeal against the approved driving instructor (ADI) registrar</li>
<p>You can claim outside of the 2 years in special situations.</p>
<h2>Who can make the claim</h2>
<p>You, as the ADI who was suspended, must sign the declaration with the application form.</p>
<p>You’re only allowed to sign the declaration on behalf of someone in limited situations, for example where the ADI has died and you’re allowed to represent them.</p>
<h2>Evidence to support your claim</h2>
<p>You should send documents that prove the basis of your claim, for example showing why you’ve based your claim for income losses on a certain hourly rate.</p>
<p>You’ll need to consider which documents will help DVSA decide that you’ve sent a valid claim, for example bank statements, payslips or a loan agreement.</p>
<h1>Working out your losses</h1>
<p>You’ll need to work out your income and non-income losses to send your claim.</p>
<h2>Work out your income losses</h2>
<p>You’ll need to work how much you’d have reasonably expected to earn during the time you were suspended.</p>
<p>This should be based on your income for a period that you can directly compare with, for example the same period the previous year.</p>
<p>You should base your claim on the period that best compares to the time you were suspended if you cannot directly compare with a previous year.</p>
<p>If your claim is for a different amount to what’s shown in the previous period, you should explain why, for example a major change in how many pupils you taught in the weeks just before you were suspended.</p>
<h2>Work out your non-income losses</h2>
<p>Your claim will need to make clear:</p>
<li>how the non-income losses were incurred</li>
<li>why they are reasonable costs</li>
<li>how you have worked them out</li>
<p>You’ll need to send documents that clearly support your claim.</p>
<p>You can claim for the value of any damage that the suspension caused to your driving school business if you run one.</p>
<p>You can claim for the interest paid on a loan that you took out because your income stopped from being suspended.</p>
<h2>Help working out your non-income losses</h2>
<p>You can claim for the cost of preparing your compensation application. This can include the cost of getting expert help to work out how much your non-income losses are.</p>
<p>You’ll need to prove that the cost was reasonable, for example by showing that you did not pay a higher fee than usually applies.</p>
<h1>The decision on your compensation claim</h1>
<p>You’ll get a letter from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) within 28 days to either:</p>
<li>tell you you’re being paid the amount you claimed for or a different amount</li>

<h2>Interim payments</h2>
<p>You can get an interim payment:</p>
<li>if you’re in special situations, for example significant financial hardship</li>
<li>for part of the claim if it can be easily and quickly checked</li>
<h2>If more information is needed</h2>
<p>You must send any extra information DVSA needs within 28 days. This can be extended in special situations.</p>
<p>You must sign a statement to say the information is true to the best of your knowledge when you send it.</p>
<h2>Not giving more information</h2>
<p>You should tell DVSA in writing if you cannot give the extra information, and the reason why. DVSA will do whatever it can to process the claim if this happens.</p>
