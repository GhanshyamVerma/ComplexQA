<h2>Reference number</h2>
<p>You’ll need to use your PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA) reference number as the payment reference.</p>
<p>It starts with an X and is on the payslip HMRC sent you. If you do not have your PSA number, contact the office that’s dealing with your application.</p>
<p>Do not use your PAYE Accounts Office reference number. Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference.</p>
<h2>How long it takes</h2>
<p>Payments made by Faster Payments (online or telephone banking) will usually reach HMRC on the same or next day, including weekends and bank holidays.</p>
<p>CHAPS payments usually reach HMRC the same working day if you pay within your bank’s processing times.</p>
<p>Bacs payments usually take 3 working days.</p>
<p>Check your bank’s transaction limits and processing times before making a payment.</p>

<p>HMRC’s banking address is:</p>
<h1>By debit or corporate credit card online</h1>
<p>You can pay online.</p>
<p>There’s a fee if you pay by corporate credit card or corporate debit card. The fee is not refundable.</p>
<p>There’s no fee if you pay by personal debit card.</p>
<p>You cannot pay by personal credit card.</p>
<p>You’ll need your PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA) reference number. It starts with an X and is on the payslip HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) sent you.</p>
<p>If you do not have your PSA number, contact the HMRC office that’s dealing with your application.</p>
<p>Do not use your PAYE Accounts Office reference number. Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference.</p>
<p>HMRC will accept your payment on the date you make it (even on bank holidays and weekends) - not the date it reaches HMRC’s account.</p>
<p>If you’re unable to pay your PSA in full by card, you should use another payment method like a bank transfer.</p>
<h1>At your bank or building society</h1>
<p>You can pay at your branch by cash or cheque. You’ll need to use the PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA) payslip sent to you by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
<p>Make your cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’.</p>
<p>Write your PSA reference number on the back of your cheque. The number starts with an X. You will find it on the payslip.</p>
<p>HMRC will accept your payment on the date you make it (if you pay it from Monday to Friday) and not the date it reaches HMRC’s account.</p>
<h1>Direct Debit</h1>
<p>Set up a Direct Debit through your business’s HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) online account to make a single payment. This means you’ll need to set up a payment each time you pay HMRC through Direct Debit.</p>
<h2>Use your reference number</h2>
<p>You’ll need your PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA) reference number. It starts with an X and is on the payslip HMRC sent you.</p>
<p>If you do not have your PSA number, contact the HMRC office that’s dealing with your application.</p>
<p>Do not use your PAYE Accounts Office reference number. Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference.</p>
<h2>How long it takes</h2>
<p>Allow 5 working days to process a Direct Debit the first time you set one up. It should take 3 working days next time if you’re using the same bank details.</p>
<p>If you pay PAYE or Class 1 National Insurance contributions by Direct Debit, make a separate Direct Debit payment for your PSA.</p>
<h1>By cheque through the post</h1>
<p>You can send a cheque by post to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
<p>You do not need to include a street name, city name or PO box with this address.</p>
<p>Allow 3 working days for your payment to reach HMRC.</p>
<h2>What to include</h2>
<p>Make your cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’.</p>
<p>Write your PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA) reference number on the back of the cheque. It starts with an ‘X’ and you’ll find it on your payslip.</p>
<p>Include the payslip HMRC sent you. Do not fold the payslip or cheque or fasten them together.</p>
<p>Your payment may be delayed if you do not fill in your cheque properly.</p>
<p>If you want a receipt, include a note asking for one.</p>
<h3>If you do not have a payslip</h3>
<p>You can print a payslip to use to pay by post. You cannot use this at a bank.</p>
<h1>Check your payment has been received</h1>
<p>You can check your bank or building society statement to confirm the payment has left your account.</p>
<p>If you’re paying by post, you can include a letter with your payment to request a receipt from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
