<p>You can make a claim yourself or use an agent (eg a professional property valuer or claims company) to claim for you.</p>

<p>You can’t claim for property that was part of a ‘compulsory purchase’ for the construction of the road.</p>
<h3>Homes</h3>
<p>You must be living in the property when you make your claim, unless you can’t because:</p>
