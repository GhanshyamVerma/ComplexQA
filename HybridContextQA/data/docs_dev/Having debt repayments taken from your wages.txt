Having debt repayments taken from your wages
<h1>When repayments can be taken</h1>
<p>You can have debt repayments taken out of your wages if you owe someone money from either:</p>
<li>unpaid maintenance payments</li>
<li>county court judgment (CCJ)</li>
<p>The person you owe money is called a ‘creditor’.</p>
<p>You can also have benefit overpayments taken from your wages by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or your local council.</p>
<h2>How you’re told</h2>
<p>You and your employer will get a document (called an ‘attachment of earnings order’) from the court. This will tell you:</p>
<li>how much you owe</li>
<li>how much your employer takes from your wages - you can apply to get this changed if you cannot afford it</li>
<li>when and how the payments have to be made</li>
<p>You and your employer can be fined if they do not follow the order. You cannot ask them to ignore it.</p>
<h1>Change how much you pay</h1>
<p>You can apply to get the payments reduced if you cannot afford them. Download and fill in form N244 and send it to the court that issued the court order.</p>
<p>You have to do this within 14 days of getting the order.</p>
<p>You can also apply if the order has been in place for some time and your circumstances change.</p>
<h2>Pay off the debt more quickly</h2>
<p>Speak to the person or company you owe the money to if you want to pay more. They might either:</p>
<li>take extra payments directly</li>
<li>agree to put the order on hold so you can pay more directly to them</li>
<p>The court will tell you if your debt is put on hold.</p>
<h1>Check how much you owe</h1>
<p>Contact the Centralised Attachment of Earning Payments (CAPS) office to check how much you still owe. They can also send you a history of the payments you’ve made.</p>
<p>You’ll need to give your case number when you call.</p>
<h1>Report a change in your circumstances</h1>
<p>You must report any changes in your circumstances if you’re paying off a debt through your wages.</p>
<h2>Change your name or address</h2>
<p>If you need to change your name or address, tell:</p>
<li>the Centralised Attachment of Earning Payments (CAPS) office</li>
<li>the court who issued the court order</li>
<li>your creditor</li>
<h2>If you change or lose your job</h2>
<li>Tell the CAPS office your new employer’s details or that you’ve lost your job.</li>
<li>Download and fill in form N56 in full, and send it to the court who issued the court order.</li>
<h1>When you’ve paid off the debt</h1>
<p>The Centralised Attachment of Earning Payments (CAPS) office will send you a ‘notice of discharge’ when the debt has been paid off. Your employer and creditor will also get a copy.</p>
<p>Your employer will then stop making deductions from your wages.</p>
<h2>If you think you’ve overpaid</h2>
<p>Ask the CAPS office to check if you’ve overpaid.</p>
<p>You’ll need to give your case number when you call.</p>
<p>You’ll get a refund if you’ve overpaid.</p>
