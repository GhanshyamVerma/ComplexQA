Give up (renounce) British citizenship or nationality
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>You can apply to give up (renounce) your British citizenship or status. If accepted, you’ll get a ‘declaration of renunciation’ that you can use to show that you’re no longer British.</p>
<p>You might do this, for example, if you want to become a citizen of another country that does not allow dual citizenship.</p>
<p>You can renounce your:</p>
<li>British citizenship</li>
<li>British overseas territories citizenship</li>
<li>British overseas citizenship</li>
<li>British subject status</li>
<li>British national (overseas) status</li>
<p>You can give up more than one at a time.</p>
<p>Giving up your citizenship or status only affects you and not any other members of your family - although it could affect the status of any children you have in future.</p>
<p>Your right to live in the UK will be affected if you give up citizenship.</p>
<h2>When you can give up your citizenship</h2>
<p>You can only give up your British citizenship or status if either of the following apply:</p>
<li>you already have another citizenship or nationality</li>
<li>you’re going to get another citizenship or nationality after giving up your British citizenship or status</li>
<p>You must also be:</p>
<li>aged 18 or over (unless you’re under 18 and married)</li>
<li>of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s in your best interest)</li>
<h1>Apply</h1>
<p>Fill in the form online. You’ll usually be able to keep your documents while your application is being processed.</p>
<p>If you live in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or a British overseas territory, you have to apply in person or by post instead. Check which you can do with your governor’s office.</p>
<p>If you live elsewhere, you can apply by post. This will take much longer than applying online because of coronavirus (COVID-19). Avoid applying by post, especially if you need your documents back by a specific date.</p>
<p>It is taking longer than usual to process applications because of coronavirus. This will not affect the decision.</p>
<h2>Get help to apply online</h2>

<h2>Time limits if you’re getting another citizenship</h2>

<p>Read the guidance to check if you can apply.</p>
