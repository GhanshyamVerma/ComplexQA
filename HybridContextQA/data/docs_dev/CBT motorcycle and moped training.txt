CBT motorcycle and moped training
<h1>Who needs to take training</h1>
<p>Compulsory basic training (CBT) is a course you usually have to take before you ride a moped or motorcycle on the road.</p>
<p>The training makes sure you can ride safely on your own while you practise for your full moped or motorcycle test.</p>
<p>CBT is not a test that you pass or fail.</p>
<p>After you’ve completed CBT, you can ride a:</p>
<li>moped if you’re 16 or over</li>
<li>motorcycle up to 125cc and with a power output of up to 11kW if you’re 17 or over</li>
<p>You must use L plates (L or D plates in Wales).</p>
<p>You must pass your full moped or motorcycle test within 2 years, or you have to either take CBT again or stop riding.</p>
<p>You can be fined up to £1,000 and get up to 6 penalty points for riding if you do not have a valid CBT certificate.</p>
<h2>When you do not need to take CBT</h2>
<p>You do not have to take CBT if you:</p>
<li>want to ride a moped (up to 50cc) and you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001</li>
<li>want to ride a motorcycle and have a full moped licence from passing a moped test since 1 December 1990</li>
<li>have a full motorcycle licence for one category and want to upgrade to another</li>
<li>live and ride on some offshore islands</li>
<li>want to ride a trial e-scooter</li>
<h1>Booking your CBT course</h1>
<p>Book your CBT course directly with a motorcycle training school.</p>
<p>The training school sets the course price. The price depends on where you do the training and if you bring your own moped or motorcycle.</p>
<p>The training school can ask you to share your driving licence information with them before the course.</p>
<h1>Preparing for your CBT course</h1>
<p>Your trainer can stop your compulsory basic training (CBT) course if your basic knowledge of The Highway Code and traffic signs is not good enough for you to ride safely.</p>
<p>You need to know:</p>
<li>the main rules that apply to moped and motorcycle riders</li>
<li>what other road users are likely to do</li>
<p>You can be charged again to retake the course if your trainer stops your training because you are not prepared.</p>
<p>You can buy the guide to learning to ride to help you prepare. You can also buy it from high street and online book shops.</p>
<h1>What to take to your course</h1>
<p>Take your UK driving licence to your training course.</p>
<h2>What you need to wear</h2>
<p>You must wear:</p>
<li>a motorcycle helmet that meets British safety standards (unless you’re Sikh and wearing a turban) - check if the training school will provide one</li>
<li>motorcycle boots or other sturdy footwear that supports and protects your ankles</li>
<li>textile or leather motorcycle trousers or heavy denim trousers</li>
<li>a textile or leather motorcycle jacket or a heavy denim jacket with several layers underneath</li>
<li>motorcycle gloves</li>
<p>Your course can be stopped and you can be charged to take it again if you do not wear suitable clothing.</p>
<h2>Using your own moped or motorcycle</h2>
<p>You cannot ride your own moped or motorcycle to the course unless you already have a CBT certificate - for example, if you’re taking CBT again before your current certificate expires.</p>
<p>You can be fined up to £1,000 and get up to 6 penalty points for riding if you do not have a valid CBT certificate.</p>
<h1>How the training works</h1>
<p>The CBT course usually lasts a full day. It can take longer depending on how quickly you learn.</p>
<p>There are 5 parts to the course:</p>
<li>introduction and eyesight check</li>
<li>on-site training</li>
<li>on-site riding</li>
<li>on-road training</li>
<li>on-road riding</li>
<p>The CBT course syllabus tells you more about what’s involved in each part.</p>
<p>You move from one part to the next when your trainer is happy you’ve:</p>
<li>learnt the theory</li>
<li>shown the practical skills to a safe basic level</li>
<h2>On-road riding</h2>
<p>The on-road riding part must last at least 2 hours. Complain to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) if the trainer cuts this short.</p>
<h2>How many people you’ll train with</h2>
<p>You might train with other learners. There’s a maximum number of:</p>
<li>4 learners per trainer for on-site parts</li>
<li>2 learners per trainer for on-road parts</li>
<p>Complain to DVSA if there are more learners than this.</p>
<h2>When you complete the course</h2>
<p>You’ll get a ‘certificate of completion’ (sometimes called a ‘DL196’) when you successfully complete the course.</p>
<p>You can then ride a moped or motorcycle up to 125cc and with a power output of up to 11kW on the road with L plates (L or D plates in Wales).</p>
<p>You must pass your theory test and full moped or motorcycle test within 2 years otherwise you’ll need to complete CBT again or stop riding.</p>
<h1>If you have a car driving licence</h1>
<p>You can ride a moped (up to 50cc) without L plates and without taking the moped test in some situations.</p>
<h2>You passed your driving test on or after 1 February 2001</h2>
<p>You’ll get a full moped licence if you either:</p>
<li>pass your car driving test and then complete a compulsory basic training (CBT) course</li>
<li>complete a CBT course and then pass your car driving test within two years</li>
<p>You can then ride a moped (up to 50cc) without L plates. You do not need to take the full moped test.</p>
<p>You can ride mopeds  for as long as your car driving licence lasts.</p>
<h2>You passed your driving test before 1 February 2001</h2>
<p>You can ride a moped (up to 50cc) without L plates. You do not need to take a CBT course or take the full moped test.</p>
<p>You must take CBT if you want to ride anything larger than a 50cc moped.</p>
